      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne morning, in a
      flat in one of the great buildings in Gorokliovaia Street, * the
      population of which was sufficient to constitute that of a provincial
      town, there was lying in bed a gentleman named Ilya Ilyitch Oblomov. He
      was a fellow of a little over thirty, of medium height, and of pleasant
      exterior. Unfortunately, in his dark-grey eyes there was an absence of any
      definite idea, and in his other features a total lack of concentration.
      Suddenly a thought would wander across his face with the freedom of a
      bird, flutter for a moment in his eyes, settle on his half-opened lips,
      and remain momentarily lurking in the lines of his forehead. Then it would
      disappear, and once more his face would glow with a radiant <i>insouciance</i>
      which extended even to his attitude and the folds of his night-robe. At
      other times his glance would darken as with weariness or <i>ennui</i>. Yet
      neither the one nor the other expression could altogether banish from his
      countenance that gentleness which was the ruling, the fundamental,
      characteristic, not only of his features, but also of the spirit it which
      lay beneath them. That spirit shone in his eyes, in his smile, and in his
      every movement of hand and head. On glancing casually at Oblomov a cold, a
      superficially observant person would have said, &ldquo;Evidently he is
      good-natured, but a simpleton;&rdquo; whereas a person of greater penetration
      and sympathy than the first would have prolonged his glance, and then gone
      on his way thoughtfully, and with a smile as though he were pleased with
      something.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  One of the principal streets of Petrograd.
</pre>
    <p>
      Oblomov&rsquo;s face was neither reddy nor dull nor pale, but of an indefinite
      hue. At all events, that was the impression which it gave&mdash;possibly
      because, through insufficiency of exercise, or through want of fresh air,
      or through a lack of both, he was wrinkled beyond his years. In general,
      to judge from the extreme whiteness of his bare neck, his small, puffy
      hands, and his soft shoulders, one would conclude that he possessed an
      effeminate body. Even when excited, his actions were governed by an
      unvarying gentleness, added to a lassitude that was not devoid of a
      certain peculiar grace. On the other hand, should depression of spirits
      show itself in his face, His glance would grow dull, and his brow
      furrowed, as doubt, despondency, and apprehension fell to contending with
      one another. Yet this crisis of emotion seldom crystallized into the form
      of a definite idea&mdash;still less into that of a fixed resolve. Almost
      always such emotion evaporated in a sigh, and shaded off into a sort of
      apathetic lethargy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov&rsquo;s indoor costume corresponded exactly with the quiet outlines of
      his face and the effeminacy of his form. The costume in question consisted
      of a dressing-gown of some Persian material&mdash;a real Eastern
      dressing-gown&mdash;a garment that was devoid both of tassels and velvet
      facings and a waist, yet so roomy that Oblomov might have wrapped himself
      in it once or twice over. Also, in accordance with the immutable custom of
      Asia, its sleeves widened steadily from knuckles to shoulder. True, it was
      a dressing-gown which had lost its pristine freshness, and had, in places,
      exchanged its natural, original sheen for one acquired by hard wear; yet
      still it retained both the clarity of its Oriental colouring and the
      soundness of its texture. In Oblomov&rsquo;s eyes It was a garment possessed of
      a myriad invaluable qualities, for it was so soft and pliable that, when
      wearing it, the body was unaware of its presence, and, like an obedient
      slave, it answered even to the slightest movement. Neither waistcoat nor
      cravat did Oblomov wear when indoors, since he loved freedom and space.
      For the same reason his slippers were long, soft, and broad, to the end
      that, whenever he lowered his legs from the bed to the floor without
      looking at what he was doing, his feet might fit into the slippers at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Oblomov, lying in bed was neither a necessity (as in the case of an
      invalid or of a man who stands badly in need of sleep ) nor an accident
      (as in the case of a man who is feeling worn out) nor a gratification (as
      in the case of a man who is purely lazy). Rather, it represented his
      normal condition. Whenever he was at home&mdash;and almost always he was
      at home&mdash;he would spend his time in lying on his back. Likewise he
      used but the one room&mdash;which was combined to serve both as bedroom,
      as study, and as reception-room&mdash;in which we have just discovered
      him. True, two other rooms lay at his disposal, but seldom did he look
      into them save on mornings (which did not comprise by any means every
      morning) when his old valet happened to be sweeping out the study. The
      furniture in them stood perennially covered over, and never were the
      blinds drawn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first sight the room in which Oblomov was lying was a well-fitted one.
      In it there stood a writing-table of redwood, a couple of sofas,
      upholstered in some silken material, and a handsome screen that was
      embroidered with birds and fruits unknown to Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also the room contained silken curtains, a few mats, some pictures,
      bronzes, and pieces of china, and a multitude of other pretty trifles. Yet
      even the most cursory glance from the experienced eye of a man of taste
      would have detected no more than a tendency to observe <i>les convenances</i>
      while escaping their actual observance. Without doubt that was all that
      Oblomov had thought of when furnishing his study. Taste of a really
      refined nature would never have remained satisfied with such ponderous,
      ungainly redwood chairs, with such rickety whatnots. Moreover, the back of
      one of the sofas had sagged, and, here and there, the wood had come away
      from the glue. Much the same thing was to be seen in the case of the
      pictures, the vases, and certain other trifles of the apartment.
      Nevertheless, its master was accustomed to regard its appurtenances with
      the cold, detached eye of one who would ask, &ldquo;Who has dared to bring this
      stuff here?&rdquo; The same indifference on his part, added to, perhaps, an even
      greater indifference on the part of his servant, Zakhar, caused the study,
      when contemplated with attention, to strike the beholder with an
      impression of all-prevailing carelessness and neglect. On the walls and
      around the pictures there hung cobwebs coated with dust; the mirrors,
      instead of reflecting, would more usefully have served as tablets for
      recording memoranda; every mat was freely spotted with stains; on the sofa
      there lay a forgotten towel, and on the table (as on most mornings) a
      plate, a salt-cellar, a half-eaten crust of bread, and some scattered
      crumbs&mdash;all of which had failed to be cleared away after last night&rsquo;s
      supper. Indeed, were it not for the plate, for a recently smoked pipe that
      was propped against the bed, and for the recumbent form of Oblomov
      himself, one might have imagined that the place contained not a single
      living soul, so dusty and discoloured did everything look, and so lacking
      were any active traces of the presence of a human being. True, on the
      whatnots there were two or three open books, while a newspaper was tossing
      about, and the bureau bore on its top an inkstand and a few pens; but the
      pages at which the books were lying open were covered with dust and
      beginning to turn yellow (thus proving that they had long been tossed
      aside), the date of the newspaper belonged to the previous year, and from
      the inkstand, whenever a pen happened to be dipped therein, there arose,
      with a frightened buzz, only a derelict fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular morning Oblomov had (contrary to his usual custom)
      awakened at the early hour of eight. Somehow he looked perturbed; anxiety,
      regret, and vexation kept chasing one another across his features.
      Evidently he had fallen a prey to some inward struggle, and had not yet
      been able to summon his wits to the rescue. The fact of the matter was
      that, overnight, he had received from the <i>starosta</i> * of his country
      estate an exceedingly unpleasant letter. We all know what disagreeable
      things a <i>starosta</i> can say in his letters&mdash;how he can tell of
      bad harvests, of arrears of debt, of diminished incomes, and so forth; and
      though this particular official had been inditing precisely similar
      epistles during the past three years, his latest communication had
      affected its recipient as powerfully as though Oblomov had received an
      unlooked-for blow. Yet, to do Oblomov justice, he had always bestowed a
      certain care upon his affairs. Indeed, no sooner had he received the <i>starosta&rsquo;s</i>
      first disturbing letter (he had done so three years ago) than he had set
      about devising a plan for changing and improving the administration of his
      property. Yet to this day the plan in question remained not fully thought
      out, although long ago he had recognized the necessity of doing something
      actually decisive.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Overseer or steward.
</pre>
    <p>
      Consequently, on awakening, he resolved to rise, to perform his ablutions,
      and his tea consumed, to consider matters, to jot down a few notes, and,
      in general, to tackle the affair properly. Yet for another halfhour he lay
      prone under the torture of this resolve; until eventually he decided that
      such tackling could best be done after tea, and that, as usual, he would
      drink that tea in bed&mdash;the more so since a recumbent position could
      not prove a hindrance to thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he did as he had decided; and when the tea had been consumed he
      raised himself upon his elbow and arrived within an ace of getting out of
      bed. In fact, glancing at his slippers, he even began to extend a foot in
      their direction, but presently withdrew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past ten struck, and Oblomov gave himself a shake. &ldquo;What is the
      matter?&rdquo; he said vexedly. &ldquo;In all conscience &rsquo;tis time that I were
      doing something! Would I could make up my mind to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He broke off with a shout of &ldquo;Zakhar!&rdquo; whereupon there entered an elderly
      man in a grey suit and brass buttons&mdash;a man who sported beneath a
      perfectly bald pate a pair of long, bushy, grizzled whiskers that would
      have sufficed to fit out three ordinary men with beards. His clothes, it
      is true, were cut according to a country pattern, but he cherished them as
      a faint reminder of his former livery, as the one surviving token of the
      dignity of the house of Oblomov. The house of Oblomov was one which had
      once been wealthy and distinguished, but which, of late years, had
      undergone impoverishment and diminution, until finally it had become lost
      among a crowd of noble houses of more recent creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Oblomov remained too plunged in thought to notice
      Zakhar&rsquo;s presence; but at length the valet coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Oblomov inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called me just now, <i>barin</i>?&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  &ldquo;Master&rdquo; or &ldquo;sir&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called you, you say? Well, I cannot remember why I did so. Return to
      your room until I <i>have</i> remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakliar retired, and Oblomov spent another quarter of an hour in thinking
      over the accursed letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lain here long enough,&rdquo; at last he said to himself. &ldquo;Really, I <i>must</i>
      rise.... But suppose I were to read the letter through carefully and <i>then</i>
      to rise? Zakhar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar re-entered, and Oblomov straightway sank into a reverie. For a
      minute or two the valet stood eyeing his master with covert resentment.
      Then he moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you going away?&rdquo; Oblomov asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, <i>barin</i>, you have nothing to say to me. Why should I stand
      here for nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Have your legs become so shrunken that you cannot stand for a
      moment or two? I am worried about something, so you <i>must</i> wait. You
      have just been lying down in your room, haven&rsquo;t you? Please search for the
      letter which arrived from the <i>starosta</i> last night. What have you
      done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter? <i>I</i> have seen no letter,&rdquo; asserted Zakhar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you took it from the postman yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I did, but how am I to know where you have since placed it?&rdquo; The
      valet fussed about among the papers and other things on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never know anything,&rdquo; remarked his master. &ldquo;Look in that basket
      there. Or possibly the letter has fallen behind the sofa? By the way, the
      back of that sofa has not yet been mended. Tell the joiner to come at
      once. It was you that broke the thing, yet you never give it a thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did <i>not</i> break it,&rdquo; retorted Zakhar. &ldquo;It broke of itself. It
      couldn&rsquo;t have lasted for ever. It was bound to crack some day.&rdquo; This was a
      point which Oblomov did not care to contest. &ldquo;Have you found the letter
      yet?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;several letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see no others,&rdquo; asserted Zakhar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s impatient reply. &ldquo;I will get up and search for
      the letter myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar retired to his room again, but had scarcely rested his hands
      against his pallet before stretching himself out, when once more there
      came a peremptory shout of &ldquo;Zakhar! Zakhar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; grumbled the valet as a third time he made for the study.
      &ldquo;Why should I be tormented in this fashion? I would rather be dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My handkerchief!&rdquo; cried Oblomov. &ldquo;Yes, and very quickly, too! You <i>might</i>
      have guessed that that is what I am wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar displayed no particular surprise or offence at this reproachful
      command. Probably he thought both the command and the reproach natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows where the handkerchief is?&rdquo; he muttered as he made a tour of
      the room and felt each chair (although he could not but have perceived
      that on them there was nothing whatsoever lying). &ldquo;You lose everything,&rdquo;
       he added, opening the door into the parlour in order to sec whether the
      handkerchief might not be lurking <i>there</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; exclaimed Oblomov. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis <i>here</i> you
      must search. I have not been into those other rooms since the year before
      last. Be quick, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no handkerchief,&rdquo; said Zakhar, spreading out his hands and peering
      into every corner. &ldquo;<i>There</i> it is!&rdquo; suddenly he croaked. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
      just underneath you. I can see its end sticking out. You have been lying
      on it all the time, yet you actually ask me to find it!&rdquo; He hobbled away
      without waiting for an answer. For a moment or two Oblomov was taken
      aback, but soon found another means of putting his valet in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice way to do your cleaning!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a lot of dust and dirt,
      to be sure! Look at those comers! You never bestir yourself at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I never bestir myself,&rdquo; retorted Zakhar offendedly, &ldquo;at least I do my
      best, and don&rsquo;t spare myself, for I dust and sweep almost every day.
      Everything looks clean and bright enough for a wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lie!&rdquo; cried Oblomov. &ldquo;Be off to your room again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That he had provoked Zakhar to engage in this conversation was a fact
      which gave him small pleasure. The truth was he had forgotten that, once a
      delicate subject is touched upon, one cannot well avoid a fuss. Though he
      wished his rooms to be kept clean, he wished this task to be carried out
      invisibly, and apart from himself; whereas, whenever Zakhar was called
      upon to do even the least sweeping or dusting, he made a grievance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Zakhar had retired to his den Oblomov relapsed into thought, until,
      a few minutes later, the clock sounded a halfhour of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; cried Oblomov in horror. &ldquo;Soon the time will be eleven,
      yet I am not yet up and washed! Zakhar! Zakhar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are my washing things ready?&rdquo; his master inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they have been ready a long time. Why do you not get up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> tell <i>me</i> that the things are ready? Had
      you done that, I should have risen long ago. Go along, and I will follow&rsquo;
      you; but at the moment I must sit down and write a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar left the room. Presently he reappeared with a much-bescribbled,
      greasy account-book and a bundle of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to write anything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you would like to
      check these accounts at the same time? Some money is due to be paid out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What accounts? What money?&rdquo; inquired Oblomov petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accounts sent in by the butcher, the greengrocer, the laundress, and
      the baker. All are wanting their money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always money and worry!&rdquo; grumbled Oblomov. &ldquo;Why do you not give me the
      accounts at intervals instead of in a batch like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because each time you have sent me away, and then put matters off until
      the morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>these</i> accounts can wait until the morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they cannot, for the creditors are pressing, and say they are going
      to allow you nothing more on credit. To-day is the first of the month, you
      must remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Fresh cares, fresh worries!&rdquo; cried Oblomov gloomily. &ldquo;Why are you
      standing there? Lay the table, and I will rise, wash, and look into the
      whole business. Is the water yet ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov raised himself and grunted as though he really intended to get out
      of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Zakhar, &ldquo;whilst you were still asleep the manager of
      the building sent the <i>dvornik</i> * to say that soon you must quit the
      flat, since he wants It for some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Porter or doorkeeper.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. We must go. Why worry me about it? This is the third
      time you have done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they keep worrying <i>me</i> about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell them that we intend to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar departed again, and Oblomov resumed his reverie. How long he would
      have remained in this state of indecision it is impossible to say had not
      a ring at the doorbell resounded through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has called, yet I am not yet up!&rdquo; exclaimed Oblomov as he
      slipped into his dressing-gown. &ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lying down again, he gazed furiously towards the door.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> here entered a
      young fellow of about twenty-five. Beaming with health and irreproachably
      dressed to a degree which dazzled the eye with its immaculateness of linen
      and gorgeousness of jewellery, he was a figure calculated to excite envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Volkov!&rdquo; cried Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good morning to you,&rdquo; returned the radiant gentleman, approaching the
      bed and looking about him for a spot whereon to deposit a hat. However,
      perceiving only dust, he retained his headgear in his hand. Next he drew
      aside the skirts of his coat (preparatory to sitting down), but a hasty
      inspection of the nearest chair convinced him that he had far better
      remain standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are not yet up?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And why on earth are you wearing a
      <i>nightshirt?</i> They have quite gone out of fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a nightshirt, it is a dressinggown,&rdquo; said Oblomov,
      nestling lovingly into the ample folds of the garment. &ldquo;Where are you
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the tailor&rsquo;s. Do you think this frock-coat a nice one?&rdquo; And he
      turned himself round and round for Oblomov&rsquo;s inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! Made with excellent taste!&rdquo; was the verdict. &ldquo;Only why is it so
      broad behind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better to ride in it. It is a riding-coat. I ordered it for to-day
      for the reason that this is the first of May and I am to go to the
      Ekaterinhov * with Gorunov. He has just got his promotion, and we intend
      to cut a dash on the strength of it. He has a roan horse&mdash;all the
      horses in his regiment are roans&mdash;and I a black. How are <i>you</i>
      going-in a carriage or on foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By neither method,&rdquo; replied Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? To-day is the first of May, and you are not going to the
      Ekaterinhov? Why, <i>every one</i> will be there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite every one,&rdquo; Oblomov lazily remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>must</i> go, though. Sophia Nikolaevna and Lydia will be occupying
      two of the seats in our carriage, but the seat facing them will be vacant.
      Come with us, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not intend to occupy the vacant seat. What sort of a figure
      should <i>I</i> cut on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you like, Mischa Gorunov shall lend you a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what is the fellow thinking?&rdquo; said Oblomov as though to himself. &ldquo;How
      come you and the Gorunov family to be so friendly with one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your word of honour not to repeat what I may tell you, and I will
      explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herewith I give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I am in love with Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! Have you been in love with her long? She seems a charming
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in love with her for three weeks,&rdquo; said Volkov, with a sigh.
      &ldquo;And Mischa, for his part, is in love with Dashenka.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Dashenka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You do not know Dashenka? Why, the whole town is raving over her
      dancing. To-night I am going to the Opera with Mischa, and he is to throw
      her a bouquet. Well, I must be off to buy the necessary camelias for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back, then, and take lunch with me. I should like to have a talk
      with you, for I have just experienced two misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, I fear, for I am lunching with Prince Tiumenev. All the
      Gorunova&mdash;yes, and Lydia, too&mdash;are to be there. What a cheerful
      house it is! And so is Tiumenev&rsquo;s country place. I have heard that it is
      to be the scene of numberless dances and tableaux this summer. Are you
      likely to be one of the guests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hospitality the Prince dispenses! This winter his guests averaged
      fifty, and sometimes a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wearisome the whole thing must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Wearisome? Why, the more the merrier. Lydia, too, used to be there&mdash;though
      in those days I never so much as noticed her. In fact, never once did I do
      so until one day I found myself &lsquo;vainly trying to forget her, vainly
      pitting reason in the lists with love.&rsquo;&rdquo; Volkov hummed the concluding
      words, and seated himself carelessly upon a chair. Almost instantly he
      leaped to his feet again, and blushed the dust from his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What quantities of dirt you keep everywhere!&rdquo; he remarked.&ldquo;&rsquo;tis
      Zakhar&rsquo;s fault, not mine,&rdquo; replied Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now I must be off, as it is absolutely necessary that I should buy
      those camelias for Mischa&rsquo;s bouquet. <i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and have tea after the opera, and tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is impossible, for I am promised to supper at the Musinskis&rsquo;. It
      is their reception day, you know. However, meet me there, and I&rsquo;ll present
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is toward at the Musinskis&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed? Why, entertainment in a house where you hear all the news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like everything else, it would bore me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and call upon the Mezdrovs, where the talk centres upon one
      topic, and one topic alone&mdash;the arts. Of nothing else will you hear
      but the Venetian School. Beethoven, Bach, Leonardo da Vinci, and so
      forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them boring subjects!&rdquo; said Oblomov with a yawn. &ldquo;What a lot of
      pedants the Mezdrovs must be! Do you never get tired of running about from
      house to house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired? Why should I? Every morning like to go out and learn the news,
      thank God, my official duties never require my actual presence, save twice
      a week, when they consist of lunching with and doing the civil to the
      General. * After that I proceed to call upon any people upon whom I have
      not called for a long while. Next there will be some new actress&mdash;whether
      at the Russian theatre or at the French. Besides, always there is the
      Opera, to which I am a subscriber. Furthermore, I am in love, and Mischa
      is about to enjoy a month&rsquo;s leave from his regiment, and the summer is on
      the point of beginning, and Mischa and I intend to retire to his country
      house for a change of air. We shall have plenty of sport there, since he
      possesses excellent neighbours and they give <i>bals champêtres</i>. Also
      I shall be able to escort Lydia for walks through the woods, and to row
      her about in a boat, and to pluck flowers for her benefit. At the present
      moment I must leave you. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  In this case the term &ldquo;General&rdquo; denotes a civil grade
     corresponding to the military rank of the same title.
</pre>
    <p>
      Rising, he endeavoured to look at himself in a dust-coated mirror; after
      which he departed&mdash;though returning once more to show his friend the
      newest thing in Parisian gloves and an Easter card which Prince Tiumenev
      had recently sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a life!&rdquo; thought Oblomov, with a shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;What good
      can a man get out of it? It is merely a squandering and a wasting of his
      all. Of course, an <i>occasional</i> look into a theatre is not a bad
      thing, nor is being in love&mdash;for Lydia is a delightful girl, and
      pursuits like plucking flowers with her and rowing her about in a boat
      even I should enjoy; but to have to be in ten different places every day,
      as Volkov has&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned over on his back and congratulated himself that <i>he</i> at
      least cherished no vain social aspirations. &rsquo;Twas better to lie
      where he was and to preserve both his nerves and his human dignity....
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ring at the doorbell interrupted his reflections. This time the
      visitor turned out to be a gentleman in a dark frock-coat with crested
      buttons whose most prominent features were a clean-shaven chin, a pair of
      black whiskers around a haggard (but quiet and sensible) face, and a
      thoughtful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Sudbinski!&rdquo; cried Oblomov cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day to <i>you</i>,&rdquo; replied the gentleman. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a long time
      since I last saw you, but you know what this devilish Civil Service means.
      Look at that bagful of reports which I have brought with me! And not only
      that, but I have had to leave word at the office that a messenger will
      find me here should I be wanted. Never do I get a single moment to
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were on the way to your office? How come you to be going so late?
      Your usual hour used to be nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it <i>used</i> to be nine, but now I go at twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see: you have recently been made the head of a department. Since
      when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Easter,&rdquo; replied Sudbinski, with a meaning nod. &ldquo;But what a lot of
      work! It is terrible! From eight to twelve in the morning I am slaving at
      home; from twelve to five at the Chancellory; and all the evening at home
      again. I have quite lost touch with my acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and lunch with me to-day, and we will drink to your promotion,&rdquo; said
      Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to-day I am lunching with the Vice-Director, as well as have a report
      to prepare by Thursday. You see, one <i>cannot</i> rely upon provincial
      advices, but must verify every return personally. Are you going to the
      Ekaterinhov to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for I am not very well,&rdquo; replied Oblomov, knitting his brows.
      &ldquo;Moreover, like yourself, I have some work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Sudbinski; &ldquo;for it is a fine day, and the only day
      on which I myself can hope for a little rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what news have you?&rdquo; asked Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a good deal-of a sort. We are required no longer to write at the end
      of our official letters &lsquo;Your humble servant,&rsquo; but merely &lsquo;Accept the
      assurance of my profound respect.&rsquo; Also we have been told that we are to
      cease to make out formal documents in duplicate. Likewise, our office has
      just been allotted three new tables and a couple of confidential clerks.
      Lastly, the Commission has now concluded its sittings. <i>There&rsquo;s</i> a
      budget of news for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of our old comrades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present, except that Svinkin has lost his case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that you work from eight to twelve, and from twelve to five,
      and again in the evening! Dear, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what should I do if I were <i>not</i> in the Service?&rdquo; asked
      Sudbinski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would just read and write on your own account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not given to every one to be a <i>littérateur</i>. For example,
      you yourself write nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for I have some property on my hands,&rdquo; said Oblomov with a sigh. &ldquo;But
      I am working out a new system for it; I am going to introduce reforms of
      various kinds. The affair worries me terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part, I <i>must</i> work, in order to make a little money.
      Besides, I am to be married this coming autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Mademoiselle Murashina. Do you remember their country villa, next to
      mine? I think you came to tea with me and met her there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have no recollection of it. Is she pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, charming. Suppose, one day, we go to lunch with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov hesitated. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said after a pause; &ldquo;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about next week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Next week let it be. But at the moment I have no suitable
      clothes. Is your <i>fiancêe</i> a financial catch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for her father is a State councillor, and intends to give her ten
      thousand roubles, as well as to let us have half his official house (a
      house of twelve rooms&mdash;the whole being furnished, heated, and lighted
      at the public expense); so we ought to do very well. Herewith I invite you
      to be my best man at the wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Sudbinski. &ldquo;I am annoyed that, as I surmise, I should be
      wanted at the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stay where you are,&rdquo; urged Oblomov. &ldquo;I desire your advice, for two
      misfortunes have just befallen me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I had better come and see you another day.&rdquo; And Sudbinski took
      his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plunged up to the ears in work, good &lsquo;friend!&rdquo; thought Oblomov as he
      watched him depart. &ldquo;Yes, and blind and deaf and dumb to everything else
      in the world! <i>Yet by going into society and at the same time, busying
      yourself about your affairs you will yet__win distinction, and promotion.
      Such is what they call &lsquo;a career&rsquo;! Yet of how</i> little use is a man like
      that! His intellect, his will, his feelings&mdash;what do they avail him?
      So many luxuries is what they are&mdash;nothing more. Such an individual
      lives out his little span without achieving a single thing worth
      mentioning; and meanwhile he works in an office from morning till night&mdash;yes,
      from morning till night, poor wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly a modicum of quiet satisfaction was to be derived from the
      thought that from nine o&rsquo;clock until three, and from eight o&rsquo;clock until
      nine on the following day, he, Oblomov, could remain lying prone on a sofa
      instead of having to trot about with reports and to inscribe multitudes of
      documents. Yes, he preferred, rather, leisure for the indulgence of his
      feelings and imagination. Plunged in a philosophical reverie, he
      overlooked the fact that by his bedside there was standing a man whose
      lean, dark face was almost covered with a pair of whiskers, a moustache,
      and an imperial. Also the new-comer&rsquo;s dress was studied in its negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Oblomov,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Penkin,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;I should like to show you a
      letter which I have just received from my <i>starnsta</i>. Whence have you
      sprung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the newsagent&rsquo;s, near by. I went to see if the papers are yet out.
      Have you read my latest article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it about?&rdquo; Oblomov asked with a faint yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About trade, about the emancipation of women, about the beautiful April
      days with which we have been favoured, and about the newly formed
      fire-brigade. How come you not to have read that article? In it you will
      see portrayed the whole of our daily life. Over and above anything else,
      you will read therein an argument in favour of the present realistic:
      tendency in literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you no other work on hand?&rdquo; inquired Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a good deal. I write two newspaper articles a week, besides
      reviewing a number of books. In addition, I have just finished a tale of
      my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is <i>it</i> about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It tells how, in a certain town, the governor used to beat the citizens
      with his own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The realistic tendency, right enough!&rdquo; commented Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said the delighted <i>littérateur</i>. &ldquo;In my tale (which is
      novel and daring in its idea) a traveller witnesses a beating of this
      kind, seeks an interview with the governor of the province, and lays
      before him a complaint. At once the said governor of the province orders
      an official who happens to be proceeding to that town for the purpose of
      conducting another investigation to inquire also into the truth of the
      complaint just laid, and likewise to collect evidence as to the character
      and behaviour of the local administrator. The official in question calls
      together the local citizens, on the pretext of a trade conference, and
      incidentally sounds them concerning the other matter. And what do you
      suppose they do? They merely smile, present their compliments, and load
      the governor of the town with praises! Thereafter the official makes
      extraneous inquiries, and is informed that the said citizens are rogues
      who trade in rotten merchandise, give underweight, cheat the Treasury, and
      indulge in wholesale immorality; wherefore the beatings have been a just
      retribution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you intend the assaults committed by the governor to figure in the
      story as the <i>fatum</i> of the old tragedians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Penkin. &ldquo;You have great quickness of apprehension, and
      ought yourself to tackle the writing of stories. Yes, it has always been
      my idea to expose the arbitrariness of our local governors, the decline of
      morality among the masses, the faulty organization existing among our
      subordinate officials, and the necessity of drastic, but legal, measures
      to counterbalance these evils. &rsquo;Tis a novel idea for a story, is it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; and to me who read so little a <i>peculiarly</i> novel one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, I have never once seen you with a book in your hand. Nevertheless,
      I beseech you to read a poem which, I may say, is shortly to appear. It is
      called &lsquo;The Love of a Blackmailer for a Fallen Woman.&rsquo; the identity ol the
      author I am not at liberty to disclose&mdash;at all events <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray give me an idea of this poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It exposes, as you will see, the whole mechanism of the social movement&mdash;but
      a mechanism that is painted only in poetic colours. Each spring of that
      engine is touched upon, and each degree of the social scale held up to the
      light. We see summoned to the bar, as it were, a weak, but vicious, lord,
      with a swarm of blackmailers who are engaged in cheating him. Also various
      categories of fallen women are dissected&mdash;French women, German women,
      and others; the whole being done with vivid and striking verisimilitude.
      Certain extracts from the poem have come to my ears, and I may say that
      the author is a great man&mdash;one hears in him the notes both of Dante
      and of Shakespeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whence has he originated?&rdquo; asked Oblomov, leaning forward in
      astonishment; but Penkin, perceiving that he had now said too much, merely
      repeated that Oblomov must read the poem, and judge for himself. This
      Oblomov declined to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Penkin. &ldquo;The thing will make a great stir and be much talked
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well: <i>let</i> people talk. &rsquo;Tis all some folks have to do.
      &rsquo;Tis their <i>métier</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, read it yourself, for curiosity&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I not seen in books!&rdquo; commented the other. &ldquo;Surely folk must
      write such things merely to amuse themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; even as I do. At the same time, what truth, what verisimilitude, do
      you not find in books! How powerfully some of them move one through the
      vivid portraiture which they contain! Whomsoever these authors take&mdash;a
      <i>tchinovnik</i>, * an officer, or a blackmailer&mdash;they paint them as
      living creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Government official.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have those authors to worry about, seeing that if, as you say,
      one chooses to take a given model for amusement&rsquo;s sake, the picture is
      sure to succeed? Yet no: real life is <i>not</i> to be described like
      that. In a system of that kind there is no understanding or sympathy, nor
      a particle of what we call humanity. &rsquo;Tis all self-conceit&mdash;no
      more. Folk describe thieves and fallen women as though they were
      apprehending them in the streets and taking them to prison. Never in the
      tales of such writers is the note of &lsquo;hidden tears&rsquo; to be detected&mdash;only
      that of gross, manifest malice and love of ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what more would you have? You yourself have said (and very aptly so)
      that seething venom, a taste for bilious incitement to vice, and a
      sneering contempt for the fallen are the only ingredients needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not the only ones,&rdquo; said Oblomov, firing up. &ldquo;Picture a thief or a
      fallen woman or a cheated fool, if you like, but do not forget the rest of
      mankind. What about humanity, pray? Writers like yourself try to write
      only with the head. What? Do you suppose the intellect can work separately
      from the heart? Why, the intellect needs <i>love</i> to fertilize it.
      Rather, stretch out your hand to the fallen and raise him weep over him if
      he is lost beyond recall, but in no case make sport of him, for he is one
      to whom there should be extended only compassion. See in him yourself, and
      act accordingly. That done, I will read you, and bow my head before you.
      But in the writings of the school of which I have spoken, what art, what
      poetical colouring, are you able to discover? Should you elect to paint
      debauchery and the mire, at least do so without making any claim to
      poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You bid me depict nature&mdash;roses, nightingales, a winter&rsquo;s
      morning, and all that sort of thing&mdash;when things like <i>these</i>
      are seething and whirling around us? Nay, we need, rather, the bare
      physiology of society. No longer are love songs required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me man, and man alone.&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;And, having given me him, do
      you try to love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i> To love the usurer, the hypocrite, the peculating and stupid
      official? Why should I do that? &rsquo;tis evident you have had little
      experience of literature! Such fellows want punishing&mdash;want turning
      out of the civic circle and the community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the civic circle and the community,&rsquo; you say?&rdquo; ejaculated Oblomov
      with a gasp as he rose and stood before Penkin. &ldquo;That is tantamount to
      saying that once in that faulty vessel there dwelt the supreme element&mdash;that,
      ruined though the man may be, he is still a human being, as even are you
      and I. Turn him out, indeed! <i>How</i> are you going to turn him out of
      the circle of humanity, out of the bosom of Nature, out of the mercy of
      God?&rdquo; Oblomov came near to shouting as he said this, and his eyes were
      blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How excited you have grown!&rdquo; said Penkin in astonishment; whereupon even
      Oblomov realized that he had gone too far. He pulled himself up, yawned
      slightly, and stretched himself out sluggishly upon the sofa. For a while
      silence reigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of books do you mostly read?&rsquo; inquired Penkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books of travel,&rdquo; replied Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you read the poem when it has come out?&rdquo; continued Penkin. &ldquo;If
      so, I will bring you a copy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor my story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov signified assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Now I must be off to press,&rdquo; continued Penkin. &ldquo;Do you
      know why I came to see you to-day? I came because I wanted to propose to
      you a visit to the Ekaterinhov. I have a conveyance of my own and,
      inasmuch as, to-morrow, I must write an article on current events, I
      thought we might jointly look over my notes on the subject, and you might
      advise me as to any point omitted. We should enjoy the expedition, I
      think. Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not well,&rdquo; said Oblomov with a frown, covering himself with the
      bedclothes. &ldquo;But you might come and lunch with me to-day, and <i>then</i>
      talk. I have just experienced a couple of misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The whole of our staff is to lunch at St. George&rsquo;s, * I fear, and
      then to go on to the festival. Also, at night I have my article to write,
      and the printer must receive the manuscript by daylight at the latest.
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  A smart restaurant in Petrograd.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At night I have my article to write,&rsquo;&rdquo; mused Oblomov after his friend&rsquo;s
      departure. &ldquo;Then when does he sleep? However, he is making some five
      thousand roubles a year, so his work is so much bread and butter to him.
      Yet to think of being continually engaged in writing, in wasting one&rsquo;s
      intellect upon trifles, in changing one&rsquo;s opinions, in offering one&rsquo;s
      brain and one&rsquo;s imagination for sale, in doing violence to one&rsquo;s own
      nature, in giving way to ebullitions of enthusiasm&mdash;and the whole
      without a single moment&rsquo;s rest, or the calling of a single halt! Yes, to
      think of being forced to go on writing, writing, like the wheel of a
      machine&mdash;writing to-morrow, writing the day after, writing though the
      summer is approaching and holidays keep passing one by! Does he <i>never</i>
      stop to draw breath, the poor wretch?&rdquo; Oblomov glanced at the table, where
      everything lay undisturbed, and the ink had become dried up, and not a pen
      was to be seen; and as he looked he rejoiced to think that <i>he</i> was
      lying there as careless as a newborn baby&mdash;not worrying at all, nor
      seeking to offer anything for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of the <i>starosta&rsquo;s</i> letter and the notice to quit?&rdquo; Yes,
      suddenly he had remembered these things; and once more he became absorbed
      in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is every one seeking me out today?&rdquo; he wondered as he waited to see
      who next should enter. This time the new-comer proved to be a man of
      uncertain age&mdash;of the age when it is difficult to guess the exact
      number of years. Also, he was neither handsome nor ugly, neither tall nor
      short, neither fair nor dark. In short, he was a man whom Nature had
      dowered with no sharp-cut, distinguishing features, whether good or bad,
      mental or physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Oblomov as he greeted him. &ldquo;So it is you, Alexiev? Whence are
      you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth. I had not thought to call upon you to-day,&rdquo; replied
      the visitor, &ldquo;but by chance I met Ovchinin, and he carried me off to his
      quarters, whither I, in my turn, have now come to convey <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To convey me to, to&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Ovchinin&rsquo;s. Already Alianov, Pchailo, and Kolhniagin are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why have they collected together? And what do they want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ovchinin desires you to lunch with him, and then to accompany him and the
      rest of us to the Ekaterinhov. Likewise he has instructed me to warn you
      to hire a conveyance. Come, get up! &rsquo;Tis fully time you were
      dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to dress? I have not yet washed myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do so at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Alexiev fell to pacing the room. Presently he halted before a
      picture which he had seen a thousand times before; then he glanced once or
      twice out of the window, took from a whatnot an article of some sort,
      turned it over in his hands, looked at it from every point of view, and
      replaced the same. That done, he resumed his pacing and whistling&mdash;the
      whole being designed to avoid hindering Oblomov from rising and performing
      his ablutions. Ten minutes passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Alexiev suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, why are you still in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you. Is it <i>really</i> necessary that I should get up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is necessary, for they are waiting for us. Besides, you said
      that you would like to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go where? I have no such desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this moment you said we would go and lunch at Ovchinin&rsquo;s, and then
      proceed to the Ekatennhov!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot. It would mean my going out into the damp. Besides, rain is
      coming on. The courtyard looks quite dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, not a single cloud is in the sky, and the courtyard
      looks dark only because you never have your windows washed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;By the way, have I yet told you of my
      misfortunes&mdash;of the letter from my <i>starosta</i>, and of the notice
      given me to quit this flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Alexiev. &ldquo;What about the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The document not being immediately forthcoming, Zakhar was summoned to
      search for it; and after it had been discovered beneath the counterpane
      Oblomov read it to his friend&mdash;though passing over certain greetings,
      added to inquiries as to the recipient&rsquo;s health. The gist of the epistle
      was that the bulk of the crops on Oblomov&rsquo;s estate were likely to fail for
      want of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Alexiev. &ldquo;One must never give way to despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would <i>you</i> do in my place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should first of all consider matters. Never ought one to come to a
      hasty decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crumpling the letter in his hands, Oblomov leaned forward with his elbows
      on his knees, and remained in that posture for a considerable time&mdash;his
      brain flooded with disturbing reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Schtoltz would come!&rdquo; at length he remarked. &ldquo;He has written that
      he is about to do so, but God knows what has happened to him! <i>He</i>
      could solve the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the doorbell rang with such vehemence that both men started, and
      Zakhar came hurrying out of his pantry.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next moment
      there entered the room a tall, loosely built man who evidently did not
      believe in refinement of costume, nor was in any way ashamed of the fact.
      This was Mikhei Andreievitch Tarantiev, a native of the same district as
      Oblomov. Though an individual of rough, sullen mien, and of rather an
      overbearing manner, he did not lack a certain keen ruggedness of wit; nor
      could any one be a better judge of mundane questions in general, nor a
      better resolver of tangled juridical problems (though usually he behaved
      rudely to the person who had sought his advice on these matters).
      Nevertheless, his abilities stopped short at a talent for verbal
      exposition; and no sooner was he called upon to transmit a theory into
      action than his whole bearing underwent a change, and in every case he
      discovered practical difficulties in the way of what he conceived to be
      the best course to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said brusquely as he extended a hairy hand. &ldquo;What do you
      mean by lying in bed like a log? Presently it will be twelve o&rsquo;clock, yet
      you are sprawling about on your back!&rdquo; The other forestalled him by
      hurriedly slipping his feet into his slippers, or the new-comer would have
      pulled him out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just about to rise,&rdquo; said Oblomov with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know how you rise&mdash;how you go rolling about until lunch-time!
      Zakhar, come and help your master to dress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar entered and glared at Tarantiev. Raising himself on his elbow,
      Oblomov stepped from the bed like a man who is thoroughly worn out, and,
      dropping into an arm-chair, sat there without moving, Meanwhile Zakhar
      pomaded, parted, and combed his master&rsquo;s hair, and then asked him if he
      desired to wash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;Do you wait a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So <i>you</i> are here?&rdquo; said Tarantiev suddenly as he turned to
      Alexiev. &ldquo;I had not seen you. By the way, what a swine is that kinsman of
      yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> kinsman?&rdquo; inquired Alexiev with a stare. &ldquo;I do not possess a
      single relative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Athanasiev. Surely he is a relative of yours? I <i>know</i> he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Alexiev, not Athanasiev,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;And I repeat that I
      do not possess a single relative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is just like you an ugly man, as well as (like yourself, again) a
      man of the name of Vassili Nikolaitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless he is no kinsman of mine. Besides, my first names are Ivan
      and Alexeitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is exactly <i>like</i> you, and a swine besides. You can tell
      him that when next you meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither possess his acquaintance nor have ever set eyes upon him,&rdquo; said
      Alexiev, opening his snuffbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a pinch,&rdquo; put in Tarantiev. &ldquo;You use the plain stuff, and not the
      French, do you? Why not use the French? Never have I seen a swine like
      that relative of yours. On one occasion I borrowed of him fifty roubles.
      That was two years ago. And fifty roubles are not a very large sum, are
      they? They are a sum which he might well have forgotten, mightn&rsquo;t he? Yes,
      he very well might. But as a matter of fact, he remembered it. Not a month
      had passed before he took to saying, whenever he met me: &lsquo;How about that
      debt?&rsquo; I assure you I found him a perfect nuisance! And only yesterday he
      walked into our office, and said to me: &lsquo;I expect you have just received
      your salary, and are therefore in a position to repay me?&rsquo; Well, I handed
      him over my salary, even though he had come there for the express purpose
      of shaming me in public. I had much ado not to put him out of the door.
      &lsquo;Poor fellow, you need the money, I suppose?&rsquo; As though I had <i>not</i>
      needed it! Am I such a rich man that I should quietly let him pouch fifty
      roubles? Oblomov, hand me a cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cigars are in that box there,&rdquo; said Oblomov, pointing to a whatnot.
      He was still posed in his usual lazy but becoming attitude&mdash;he was
      still taking no notice whatever of what was being done or said around him,
      but contemplating his small white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a rubbishy weed!&rdquo; Tarantiev remarked, after sending out a puff of
      tobacco smoke and inhaling another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come too early in the morning,&rdquo; suggested Oblomov with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am boring you, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was merely making a remark. Usually you arrive at lunch-time, but
      to-day you have come an hour beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come an hour beforehand because I wish to find out what there is
      likely to be to eat at dinner. As a rule you provide such rubbishy stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go into the kitchen and inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taramiev departed for the purpose,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to have beef and veal,&rdquo; he remarked, on returning. &ldquo;Ah, friend
      Oblomov, though a landowner, you haven&rsquo;t the smallest notion how to live.
      Your <i>ménage</i> is the <i>ménage</i> of a tradesman. Have you bought
      that Madeira yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Oblomov, scarcely noticing what had been said.
      &ldquo;You had better inquire of Zakhar. At all events there will be some sort
      of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? The rubbishy old stuff which you bought of a German dealer? You
      ought to go to the English Store for your wines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Please send to the Store for some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money first, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov fumbled in a cashbox, and produced therefrom a ten-rouble, note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madeira costs seven roubles the bottle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here are ten roubles.
      You will be given change at the Store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tarantiev hastened to cram the note into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likewise, do you feel like hiring a conveyance and going to the
      Ekaterinhov today?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;If so, you might take me with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met with two misfortunes,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;In the first place, I am
      to be turned out of this fiat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you haven&rsquo;t paid your rent, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is <i>not</i> the reason. I always pay in advance. Tell me what
      had better be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made <i>me</i> your adviser? Do you think I give advice for nothing?
      Ask <i>him</i>, rather&rdquo;&mdash;and Tarantiev pointed to Alexiev&mdash;&ldquo;or
      else that kinsman of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Tell me what I ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you to move to another flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have said that myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the flat of a friend of mine in the Veaborg Quarter,&rdquo; continued
      Tarantiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? To a flat in the Veaborg Quarter? In winter the whole district is
      overrun with wolves!&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Veaborg Quarter is one of the most outlying suburbs of
     Petrograd.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, at times they come there from the Neva Islands, but my friend&rsquo;s
      house has high walls to it, and, in addition, she and her family and a
      bachelor brother are nice people, and not like that fellow over there.&rdquo; He
      pointed to Alexiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has all this to do with me?&rdquo; said Oblomov irritably. &ldquo;I tell you
      I am <i>not</i> going to move there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; exclaimed Tarantiev. &ldquo;In that house you would be much quieter
      and more comfortable than you are here, and you would pay less, and you
      would have larger quarters. Besides, it is a more respectable place than
      this. Here one has to sit at a dirty table on which the pepper-pot is
      empty, the vinegar bottle the same, the knives are not clean, the
      tablecloth is falling to pieces, and dust, dust, dust, lies everywhere.
      Give me my cab-fare, and I will go and secure you the flat at once. Then
      you can move into it to-morrow.&rdquo; Tarantiev started to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried Oblomov. &ldquo;I tell you I am <i>not</i> going to the
      Veaborg Quarter. Pray exercise your wits in contriving how I may remain
      where I am. Moreover, I have a still more important affair on hand. That
      is to say, I have just received from my <i>starosta</i> a letter
      concerning which I should be glad of your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he searched for the document, found it after some difficulty,
      and read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you hear what the <i>starosta</i> says as to drought and a failure of
      the crops? What ought I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prime necessity,&rdquo; replied Tarantiev, &ldquo;is complete quiet for you. That
      you would get at the house of the friend of whom I have just spoken; and I
      could come to see you every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;But what about this affair of the <i>starosta?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>starosta</i> is lying. He is a thief and a rogue. Why, I know an
      estate, only fifty versts from yours, where the harvest of last year was
      so good that it cleared the owner completely of debt. That being so, why
      have the crops on <i>your</i> estate threatened to fail? Clearly the <i>starosta</i>
      is a robber. If I were there I&rsquo;d teach him! Do you suppose this letter to
      be a natural, an honest one? No, no more than we can suppose that that
      sheep&rsquo;s head over there he pointed to Alexiev again&mdash;&ldquo;is capable of
      writing an honest letter, or his kinsman either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom am I to appoint in the <i>starosta&rsquo;s</i> place?&rdquo; asked Oblomov.
      &ldquo;Another man might prove even worse than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yourself had better go to the estate, and stay there for the summer,
      and then move into my friend&rsquo;s house. <i>I</i> will see that her rooms
      shall be ready for you&mdash;yes, I will see to it at once. Personally, I
      should have sold that property of yours, and bought another. Hand it over
      to me, and I will very soon make the folk there aware that I am alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of it was that Oblomov accorded a half-hearted consent to
      Tarantiev&rsquo;s procuring him a new lodging, and also to his writing to the
      governor of the district where his (Oblomov&rsquo;s) property was situated.
      After that Tarantiev departed, stating that he would return to dinner at
      five o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Tarantiev&rsquo;s departure a calm of ten minutes reigned in the apartment.
      Oblomov was feeling greatly upset, both by the <i>starostas</i> letter and
      by the prospect of the impending removal. Also, the tumultuous Tarantiev
      had thoroughly tired him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not sit down and write the letter?&rdquo; asked Alexiev. &ldquo;If you
      wish I will clean the inkstand for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean it, and the Lord bless you!&rdquo; sighed Oblomov. &ldquo;Let me write the
      letter alone, and then you shall fair-copy it after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Alexiev. &ldquo;But now I must be off, or I shall be
      delaying the Ekaterinhov party. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov did not heed him, but, sinking back into a recumbent position in
      the armchair, relapsed into a state of meditative lethargy.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Z</span>akhar, after
      closing the dour successively behind Tarantiev and Alexiev, stood
      expecting to receive a summons from his master, inasmuch as he had
      overheard the fact that the latter had undertaken to write a letter. But
      in Oblomov&rsquo;s study all remained silent as the tomb. Zakhar peeped through
      the chink of the door, and perceived that his master was lying prone on
      the sofa, with his head resting on the palm of his hand. The valet entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you lain down again?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not disturb me: cannot you see that I am reading?&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s
      abrupt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but you ought to wash, and then to write that letter,&rdquo; urged Zakhar,
      determined not to be shaken on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I ought. I will do so presently. Just now I am engaged in
      thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he <i>did</i> read a page of the book which was lying
      open&mdash;a page which had turned yellow with a month&rsquo;s exposure. That
      done, he laid it down and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it all wearies me!&rdquo; he whispered, stretching, and then drawing up,
      his legs. Glancing at the ceiling as once more he relapsed into a
      voluptuous state of coma, he said to himself with momentary sternness: &ldquo;No&mdash;business
      first.&rdquo; Then he rolled over, and clasped his hands behind his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lay there he thought of his plans for improving his property.
      Swiftly he passed in review certain grave and fundamental schemes
      affecting his plough-land and its taxation; after which he elaborated a
      new and stricter course to be taken against laziness and vagrancy on the
      part of the peasantry, and then passed to sundry ideas for ordering his
      own life in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, he became engrossed in a design for a new house. Eagerly he
      lingered over a probable disposition of the rooms, and fixed in his mind
      the dimensions of the dining-room and the billiard-room, and determined
      which way the windows of his study must face. Indeed, he even gave a
      thought to the furniture and to the carpets. Next, he designed a wing for
      the building, calculated the number of guests whom that wing would
      accommodate, and set aside proper sites for the stables, the coachhouses,
      and the servants&rsquo; quarters. Finally he turned his attention to the garden.
      The old lime and oak-trees should all be left as they were, but the
      apple-trees and pear-trees should be done away with, and succeeded by
      acacias. Also, he gave a moment&rsquo;s consideration to the idea of a park,
      but, after calculating the cost of its upkeep, came to the conclusion that
      such a luxury would prove too expensive&mdash;wherefore he passed to the
      designing of orangeries and aviaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      So vividly did these attractive visions of the future development of his
      estate flit before his eyes that he came to fancy himself already settled
      there, and engaged in witnessing the result of several years&rsquo; working of
      his schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a fair summer&rsquo;s evening he seemed to be sitting at a tea-table on the
      terrace of Oblomovka&mdash;sitting under a canopy of leafy shade which the
      sun was powerless to penetrate. From a long pipe in his hand he was lazily
      inhaling smoke, and revelling both in the delightful view which stretched
      beyond the circle of the trees and in the coolness and the quiet of his
      surroundings. In the distance some fields were turning to gold as the sun,
      setting behind a familiar birch-grove, tinged to red the mirror-like
      surface of the lake. From the fields a mist had risen, for the chill of
      evening was falling, and dusk approaching apace. To his ears, at
      intervals, came the clatter of peasantry as they returned homewards, and
      at the entrance gates the servants of the establishment were sitting at
      ease, while from their vicinity came the sound of echoing voices and
      laughter, the playing of <i>balalaiki</i>, * and the chattering of girls
      as they pursued the sport of <i>goriclki</i>. ** Around him, also, his
      little ones were frisking at times climbing on to his knee and hanging
      about his neck; while behind the <i>samovar</i> *** was seated the real
      ruler of all that his eyes were beholding his divinity, a woman, his <i>wife!</i>...
      And in the dining-room&mdash;a room at once elegant and simply appointed&mdash;a
      cheerful fire was glowing, and Zakhar, now promoted to the dignity of a
      major-domo, and adorned with whiskers turned wholly grey, was laying a
      large, round table to a pleasant accompanying tinkle of crystal and silver
      as he arranged, here a decanter and there a fork.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Three-stringed, lute-like instruments.

     **  A sort of catch-as catch-can.

     ***  Tea-urn.
</pre>
    <p>
      Presently the dreamer saw his wife and himself sit down to a bountiful
      supper. Yes, and with them was Schtoltz, the comrade of his youth, his
      unchanging friend, with other well-known faces. Lastly, he could see the
      inmates of the house retiring to rest....
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov&rsquo;s features blushed with delight at the vision. So clear, so vivid,
      so poetical was it all that for a moment he lay with his face buried in
      the sofa cushions. Suddenly there had come upon him a dim longing for love
      and quiet happiness; suddenly he had become athirst for the fields and the
      hills of his native place, for his home, for a wife, for children....
    </p>
    <p>
      After lying face downwards for a moment or two, he turned upon his back.
      His features were alight with generous emotion, and for the time being he
      was&mdash;<i>happy</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the charming seductiveness of sleep-waking enfolded him in its
      embrace. He pictured to himself a small colony of friends who should come
      and settle in the villages and farms within a radius of fifteen or twenty
      versts of his country house. Every day they should visit one another&rsquo;s
      houses&mdash;whether to dine or to sup or to dance; until everywhere
      around him he would be able to see only bright faces framed in sunny days&mdash;faces
      which should be ever free of care and wrinkles, and round, and merry, and
      ruddy, and double-chinned, and of unfailing appetite. In all his
      neighbourhood there should be constant summertide, constant gaiety,
      unfailing good fare, the joys of perennial lassitude.... &ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo;
       he cried in the fullness of his delight: and with that he awoke. Once more
      to his ears came the cries of hawkers in the courtyard as they vended
      coal, sand, and potatoes; once more he could hear some one begging for
      subscriptions to build a church; once more from a neighbouring building
      which was in course of erection there streamed a babel of workmen&rsquo;s
      shouts, mingled with the clatter of tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed with a sense of pain. &ldquo;Such is real life! What ugliness
      there is in the roar of the capital! When shall I attain the life of
      paradise&mdash;the life for which I yearn? Shall I ever see my own fields,
      my own forests? Would that at this moment I were lying on the grass under
      a tree, and gazing upwards at the sun through the boughs, and trying to
      count the birds which come and go over my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what about the plans for improving the estate? And what about the <i>starosta</i>
      and the flat? Once again these things knocked at his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered them. &ldquo;<i>Seichass</i>&mdash;presently.&rdquo;

    <p>
      With that he rose to a sitting posture on the sofa, lowered his legs to
      the level of his slippers, and slipped the latter on to his feet; after
      which he sat still for a little while. At length he attained a wholly
      erect posture, and remained meditating for a couple of minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zakhar! Zakhar!&rdquo; he shouted as he eyed the table and the inkstand. &ldquo;I
      want you to, to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Further he failed to get, but mutely
      pointed to the inkstand, and then relapsed into thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorbell rang, and a little man with a bald head entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, doctor!&rdquo; Oblomov exclaimed as he extended one hand towards his
      guest, and with the other one drew forward a chair. &ldquo;What chance brings
      you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chance that, since all of you decline to be ill, and never send for
      me, I am forced to come of myself,&rdquo; replied the doctor jestingly. &ldquo;But
      no,&rdquo; he added, in a more serious tone. &ldquo;The truth is, I had to visit a
      neighbour of yours on the upper floor, and thought I might as well take
      you on the way. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov shook his head despondently. &ldquo;Poorly, doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
      just been thinking of consulting you. My stomach will scarcely digest
      anything, there is a pain in the pit of it, and my breath comes with
      difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your wrist,&rdquo; said the doctor. He closed his eyes and felt the
      patient&rsquo;s pulse. &ldquo;And have you a cough?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;at night-time, but more especially while I am at supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! And does your heart throb at all, or your head ache?&rdquo; He then added
      other questions, bowed his bald pate, and subsided into profound
      meditation. At length he straightened himself with a jerk, and said with
      an air of decision&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three years more, of this room, of lying about, of eating rich,
      heavy foods, and you will have a stroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what ought I to do, doctor? Tell me, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely what other people do&mdash;namely, go abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, doctor, but how am I to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you not? Does money prevent you, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; money is the reason,&rdquo; replied Oblomov, gladly catching at the
      excuse, which was the most natural one that could possibly have been
      devised. &ldquo;See here&mdash;just read what my <i>slarosta</i> writes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, but that is no business of mine,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;<i>My</i>
      business is to inform you that you must change your mode of life, and also
      your place of residence. You must have fresh air&mdash;you must have
      something to do. Go to Kissingen or to Ems, and remain there during June
      and July, whilst you drink the waters. Then go on to Switzerland, or to
      the Tyrol, and partake of the local grape cure. That you can do during
      September and October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh the devil take the Tyrol!&rdquo; murmured Oblomov under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, transfer yourself to some dry place like Egypt, and put away from
      you all cares and worries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;I only wish that <i>starostas</i>&rsquo; letters
      like this one reached you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also you must do no thinking whatsoever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thinking, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you must impose upon the brain no exertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about my plans for my estate? I am not a log, if you will pardon
      my saying so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. I have merely been warning you. Likewise, you must avoid
      emotion of every kind, for that sort of thing is sure to militate against
      a successful cure. Try, rather, to divert yourself with riding, with
      dancing, with moderate exercise in the open air, and with pleasant
      conversation&mdash;more especially conversation with the opposite sex.
      These things are designed to make your heart beat more lightly, and to
      experience none but agreeable emotions. Again, you must lay aside all
      reading and writing. Rent a villa which faces south and lies embowered in
      flowers, and surround yourself also with an atmosphere of music and
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I eat at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly; but avoid all animal and farinaceous food, as well as
      anything which may be served cold. Eat only light soups and vegetables.
      Even in <i>this</i> great care will need to be exercised, for cholera, I
      may tell you, is about. Walk eight hours out of every twenty-four; go in
      for shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; groaned Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; concluded the doctor, &ldquo;go to Paris for the winter, where,
      surrounded by a whirlpool of gaiety, you will best be able to distract
      your mind from your habitual brooding. Cultivate, theatres, balls,
      masquerades, the streets, society friends, noise, and laughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; inquired Oblomov, with ill-concealed impatience. The
      doctor reflected a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; also get the benefit of sea air,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cross over to England,
      or else go for a voyage to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With chat he rose to take his leave. &ldquo;Should you carry out these
      instructions to the letter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Of <i>course</i> I shall carry them out!&rdquo; said Oblomov bitterly
      as he accompanied the physician to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor having departed, Oblomov threw himself back into an arm-chair,
      clasped his hands behind his head, and remained sitting in an almost
      unthinking heap. Roused by Zakhar to consider once more the question of
      changing his quarters, he engaged in a long and heated conversation with
      the valet. Eventually he dismissed the man to his den, but could not
      dismiss from his own mind certain comparisons which Zakhar had drawn
      between his master&rsquo;s life and the life of ordinary people. How strange
      that suddenly there should have dawned in him thoughts concerning human
      fate and destiny! All at once he found his mind drawing a parallel between
      that destiny and his own existence; all at once questions of life arose
      before his vision, like owls in an ancient ruin flushed from sleep by a
      stray ray of sunlight. Somehow he felt pained and grieved at his arrested
      development, at the check which had taken place in his moral growth, at
      the weight which appeared to be pressing upon his every faculty. Also
      gnawing at his heart there was a sense of envy that others should be
      living a life so full and free, while all the time the narrow, pitiful
      little pathway of his own existence was being blocked by a great boulder.
      And in his hesitating soul there arose a torturing consciousness that many
      sides of his nature had never yet been stirred, that others had never even
      been touched, and that not one of them had attained complete formation.
      Yet with this there went an aching suspicion that, buried in his being, as
      in a tomb, there still remained a moribund element of sweetness and light,
      and that it was an element which, though hidden in his personality, as a
      nugget lies lurking in the bowels of the earth, might once have become
      minted into sterling coin. But the treasure was now overlaid with rubbish&mdash;was
      now thickly littered over with dust. &rsquo;Twas as though some one had
      stolen from him, and besmirched, the store of gifts with which life and
      the world had dowered him; so that always he would be prevented from
      entering life&rsquo;s field and sailing across it with the aid of intellect and
      of will. Yes, at the very start a secret enemy had laid a heavy hand upon
      him and diverted him from the road of human destiny. And now he seemed to
      be powerless to leave the swamps and wilds in favour of that road. All
      around him was a forest, and ever the recesses ox his soul were growing
      dimmer and darker, and the path more and more tangled, while the
      consciousness of his condition kept awaking within him less and less
      frequently&mdash;to arouse only for a fleecing moment his slumbering
      faculties. Brain and volition alike had become paralysed, and, to all
      appearances, irrevocably&mdash;the events of his life had become whittled
      down to microscopical proportions. Yet even with them he was powerless to
      cope&mdash;he was powerless to pass from one of them to another.
      Consequently they bandied him to and fro like the waves of the ocean.
      Never was he able to oppose to any event elasticity of will; never was he
      able to conceive, as the result of any event, a reasoned-out impulse. Yet
      to confess this, even to himself, always cost him a bitter pang: his
      fruitless regrets for lost opportunities, coupled with burning reproaches
      of conscience, always pricked him like needles, and led him to strive to
      put away such reproaches and to discover a scapegoat....
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Oblomov sank asleep; and as he slept he dreamed of a different
      period, of different people, of a different place from the present. Let us
      follow him thither.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span> e find ourselves
      transported to a land where neither sea nor mountains nor crags nor
      precipices nor lonely forests exist&mdash;where, in short, there exists
      nothing grand or wild or immense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what advantage, indeed, is the grand, the immense? The ocean depresses
      the soul of man, and at the sight of its boundless expanse of billows&mdash;an
      expanse whereon the weary eye is allowed no resting-place from the
      uniformity of the picture&mdash;the heart of man grows troubled within
      him, and he derives no solace from the roaring and mad rolling of the
      waves. Ever since the world began, those waves have sung the same dim,
      enigmatical song. Ever since the world began, they have voiced but the
      querulous lament of a monster which, everlastingly doomed to torment,
      utters a chorus of shrill, malicious cries. On the shores of the sea no
      bird warbles; only the silent gulls, like lost spirits, fit wearily along
      its margin, or circle over its surface. In the presence of that turmoil of
      nature the roar even of the wildest beast sounds weak, and the voice of
      man becomes wholly overwhelmed. Yes, beside it man&rsquo;s form looks so small
      and fragile that it is swallowed up amid the myriad details of the
      gigantic picture. That alone may be why contemplation of the ocean
      depresses man&rsquo;s soul. During periods, also, of calm and immobility his
      spirit derives no comfort from the spectacle; for in the scarcely
      perceptible oscillation of the watery mass he sees ever the slumbering,
      incomprehensible force, which, until recently, has been mocking his proud
      will and, as it were, submerging his boldest schemes, his most dearly
      cherished labours and endeavours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way, mountains and gorges were not created to afford man
      encouragement, inasmuch as, with their terrible, menacing aspect, they
      seem to him the fangs and talons of some gigantic wild beast&mdash;of a
      beast which is reaching forth in an effort to devour him. Too vividly they
      remind him of his own frail build; too painfully they cause him to go in
      fear for his life. And over the summits of those crags and precipices the
      heavens look so remote and unattainable that they seem to have become
      removed out of the ken of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so that peaceful corner of the earth upon which our hero, in his
      slumber, opened his eyes. There, on the contrary, the heavens seemed to
      hug the earth&mdash;not in order that they might the better aim their
      thunderbolts, but in order that they might the closer enfold it in a
      loving embrace. In fact, they hovered low in order that, like a
      sheltering, paternal roof, they might guard this chosen corner of the
      earth from every adversity. Meanwhile the sun shone warm and bright during
      half the year, and, withdrawing, did so so slowly and reluctantly that it
      seemed ever to be turning back for one more look at the beloved spot, as
      though wishing to give it one more bright, warm day before the approaching
      weather of autumn. Also the hills of that spot were no more than reduced
      models of the terrible mountains which, in other localities, rear
      themselves to affright the imagination. Rather, they resembled the gentle
      slopes down which one may roll in sport, or where one may sit and gaze
      dreamily at the declining sun Below them, toying and frisking, ran a
      stream. In one place it discharged itself into a broad pool, in another it
      hurried along in a narrow thread, in a third it slackened its pace to a
      sudden mood of reverie, and, barely gliding over the stones, threw out on
      either side small rivulets whereof the gentle burbling seemed to invite
      sleep. Everywhere the vicinity of this corner of the earth presented a
      series of landscape studies and cheerful, smiling vistas. The sandy,
      shelving bank of the stream, a small copse which descended from the summit
      of that bank to the water, a winding ravine of which the depths were
      penetrated by a rill, a plantation of birch-trees&mdash;all these things
      seemed purposely to be fitted into one another, and to have been drawn by
      the hand of a master. Both the troubled heart and the heart which has
      never known care might have yearned to hide themselves in this forgotten
      corner of the world, and to live its life of ineffable happiness.
      Everything promised a quiet existence which should last until the grey
      hairs were come, and thereafter a death so gradual as almost to resemble
      the approach of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the yearly round fulfils itself in a regular, serene order. As the
      calendar ordains, spring comes in in March, when turbid rivulets begin to
      run from the hills, and the earth, thawing, steams with tepid vapour. Then
      the peasant, doffing his sheepskin, goes out in shirtsleeves alone, and
      shades his eyes with&rsquo; his hand as gladly he shrugs his shoulders and
      drinks his fill of the gleaming sunlight. Then, with a shaft in either
      hand, he draws forth the cart which has been lying bottom upwards, under
      the tiltshed, or examines and sounds with his foot the plough which has
      been reposing in the penthouse. All this is in preparation for the usual
      routine of toil, since in that region spring sees no return of sudden
      snowstorms to heap the fields and crack the branches. On the other hand,
      Winter, like a cold, unapproachable beauty, retains her character until
      the lawful season of thaw has arrived. Never does she mock one with
      unexpected softenings of the air; never does she triple-harness the earth
      with unheard-of degrees of frost. Everything proceeds according to rote&mdash;according
      to a generally prescribed order of nature. Although, in November, there
      begin snow and frost which, towards the festival of Epiphany, increase to
      the point of freezing to an icicle the beard of the peasant who has
      stepped out of his hut for a breath of fresh air, the sensitive nose can,
      by February, detect the kindly odour of approaching spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the summer is peculiarly ravishing. Only in that particular spot can
      one find that fresh, dry perfume which is the scent neither of laurel nor
      of lemon, but of mingled wormwood, pine, and cherry-blossom. Only there,
      also, can one find those bright days when the sun&rsquo;s rays are warm, but
      never scorching, and the sky remains cloudless for three mouths on end. As
      the bright days draw on they lengthen, week by week; and during that
      period the evenings are hot and the nights stifling, while the stars
      twinkle in the heavens with the welcoming mien of friends. And when rain
      at length arrives, how beneficent is its coming! Boisterously, richly,
      merrily it spates forth, like the large, hot tears of a man unexpectedly
      relieved of care; and as soon as ever it has passed the sun appears with a
      new smile of love, to dry the fields and the hillocks, and to cause all
      the countryside to assume an answering smile of delight. How gladly, too,
      the peasant greets the rain! &ldquo;The good rain washes us, and the sun will
      dry us again,&rdquo; is his saying as he exposes his face to the tepid downpour
      and lets it play upon his shoulders and back. Moreover, in that region
      thunder is never terrible, but, rather, benevolent, and always occurs at
      one particular season (generally on Saint Elias&rsquo; Day, in order that the
      people&rsquo;s established tradition may be fulfilled * ). Also it would appear
      that, every year, both the number and the intensity of the peals remain
      the same&mdash;as though for each year the heavenly treasury had allotted
      a given measure of electricity. But of terrible and destructive storms
      that country can shew no record.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Namely, that, should thunder occur on that day, the whole
     of the ensuing year will be prosperous, since the peals
     represent the saint&rsquo;s passage to heaven.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nor has the country whereof I am speaking ever been visited with the
      Egyptian or other plagues. Never has any member of its population beheld a
      dire manifestation of Heaven, nor a thunderbolt, nor an unlooked-for
      darkness; nor do venomous vermin abide there, and the locust comes not
      thither, and lions, tigers, bears, and wolves are unknown ( owing to the
      fact that the country contains no fastnesses for them to dwell in). In
      short, over the fields and around the village wander only lowing cattle,
      bleating sheep, and cackling poultry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet none but God knows whether a poet or a visionary would find himself
      satisfied with the natural features of this peaceful spot. Such gentlemen,
      we know, love to gaze upon the moon, and to listen to. the strains of
      nightingales; they love to see Luna clothe herself in coquettish, aureate
      cloud, and then glide mysteriously through the boughs of trees, and send
      forth clusters of silver beams to delight the eyes of her worshippers&rsquo;!
      But in this country of Oblomov&rsquo;s dream no one knows such a moon; there
      Luna&rsquo;s features, as she looks down upon the villages and the fields,
      resembles, rather, a polished, cheery copper basin, and in vain would the
      poet fasten ravished eyes upon her, for she would return his gaze with the
      same indifference as that with which a round-faced rustic beauty meets the
      eloquent, passionate glances of a town gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor has a nightingale ever been heard in that country&mdash;perchance for
      the reason that the region contains no shaded arbours or gardens of roses.
      But what an abundance of quails it can show!&mdash;so much so that in
      summer, when the harvest is in course of being gathered, urchins can catch
      them even in their hands! Yet it must not be supposed that thereafter the
      quails furnish a gastronomic dainty. Such an outrage would be repugnant to
      the moral sense of the inhabitants, since the quail is a bird, and
      therefore legally prohibited from being used for food. Consequently it
      lives but to delight the popular ear with its song, and in almost every
      house there hangs beneath the eaves a wicker cage wherein a member of that
      feathered species sits penned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the general aspect of this modest, unaffected spot would fail to
      please the poet or the visionary. Never would it be theirs to behold a
      scene in which all nature&mdash;woodland, lake, cotter&rsquo;s hut, and sandy
      hillside&mdash;is burning with a purplish glow, while sharply defined
      against a purple background may be seen moving along a sandy, winding
      road, a cavalcade of countrymen in attendance upon some great lady who is
      journeying towards a ruined castle&mdash;a castle where they will find
      awaiting them the telling of legends concerning the Wars of the Roses, the
      eating of wild goats for supper, and the singing of ballads to the lute by
      a young English damsel&mdash;a scene of Scottish or Swiss flavour of the
      kind which has been made familiar to our imagination by the pen of Sir
      Waiter Scott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this there is nothing in our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      How quiet and dreamy are the three or four villages which constitute that
      restful region! They lie not far from one another, and seem to have been
      thrown into their respective positions by some giant hand, and ever since
      to have maintained those positions. In particular, one hut stands on the
      edge of a ravine, with one-half its bulk projecting over the declivity,
      but supported on three props. Within it some three or four generations
      have spent happy, peaceful lives; for though it looks scarcely large
      enough to house a chicken, it is none the less tenanted by a well-to-do
      peasant and his wife. Onisim Suslov is the peasant&rsquo;s name, and he cannot
      stand upright in his abode. The veranda actually overhangs the ravine, and
      to reach it one has with one hand to grasp the herbage, and, with the
      other, the gable before setting foot upon the structure itself. Another of
      the huts is, as it were, gummed to the side of a hill, like a swallow&rsquo;s
      nest, while three others stand close beside it, and two are situated at
      the bottom of the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the village all is quiet. The doors of its solitary little dwellings
      stand open, but not a soul is to be seen. Only the flies circle and buzz
      in clusters. Were you to enter one of the huts, you would call aloud in
      vain, for your only answer would be the deathlike silence, except that
      here and there you might hear the gasping of an invalid or the deep cough
      of some old woman who is living out her days upon the stove. Also, there
      might appear from behind the fence a long-haired, barefooted youngster of
      three, clad only in a shirt, who would gaze mutely at the new-comer, and
      then timidly hide himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same deep silence, the same deep peace, lies also upon the fields.
      Only somewhere over the distant soil there can be seen moving, like an
      ant, a sunburnt ploughman. Occasionally he leans upon his plough to clear
      his forehead of the sweat. Even the manners of that region are possessed
      of a still restfulness which nothing can disturb. Never has a robbery or a
      murder or a similar happening been known there; never have the inhabitants
      succumbed to strong passions, or experienced hazardous adventures. Indeed,
      what passions, what adventures would have the power to move them? No man
      has ever strayed beyond his own circle, for the local inhabitants dwell
      far from other men, and both the nearest village and the nearest country
      town lie distant from twenty-five to thirty versts.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, at given seasons the peasants cart their grain to the river wharf
      which lies nearest to them, and once a year, also, they attend a fair; but
      they maintain no relations beyond these. In fact, all their interests are
      centred in themselves. True, they know that eighty versts away there
      stands the provincial capital; but few of them have ever journeyed
      thither. Also they know that beyond it stand Saratov and Nizhni Novgorod&mdash;likewise
      they have heard that such places as Moscow and Petrograd exist, and that
      on the farther side of them dwell folk who are known as Germans and
      French; but beyond that point there begins for them, as it did for the
      ancients, a mysterious world of unknown countries which are peopled with
      monsters and two-headed giants, and bounded on the outer side by a void of
      mist, and, again, by the colossal fish which bears the world on its bark.
      Moreover, since this peaceful corner of the universe is almost
      inaccessible, there filters thither but few items of news concerning the
      great white universe. * Indeed, even traders in rustic wares who live
      twenty versts away know no more than they do. Likewise, it never enters
      into their heads to compare their lot with those of other men&mdash;to
      inquire whether other men are rich or poor, comfortable or in need, for
      these peasants live in the fortunate belief that no circumstances could
      ever be different to their own&mdash;that all other folk must surely be
      living even as they are, and that to live in any other fashion would be a
      sin. Were you to assure them that others plough, sow, reap, or sell their
      produce in any way than that which obtains in this particular spot, the
      inhabitants would not believe you. That being so, how could any element of
      vexation or disturbance ever come nigh them? True, they resemble the rest
      of humanity in that they have their cares and weaknesses and obligations
      of lax-payment and fits of laziness and lethargy; but these press upon
      them but lightly, and occasion no real stirring of the blood. Indeed,
      during the past five years not a single soul of that local population of
      hundreds has died either a violent death or a natural. Even should a mar
      or a woman expire of old age or a senile disease, it is not long before
      the rest have got ever their astonishment at the unusual occurrence. In
      the same way, after the trader Tarass had come near to steaming himself to
      death in his hut, and had had to be revived with cold water, the affair
      caused scarcely any stir in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * As distinguished from the black universe, the unknown.

    <p>
      Of crimes, one only&mdash;that of theft of produce from market gardens&mdash;is
      at all prevalent. Also, once two pigs and a chicken mysteriously
      disappeared. True, the latter event threw the district into something of a
      turmoil, but was unanimously ascribed to a pedlar who, the previous
      evening, had passed through the district on his way to a fair. In general,
      such untoward incidents are of the greatest rarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in a ditch in a paddock near the bridge once there was found
      lying a man&mdash;apparently a member of a party which had just traversed
      the neighbourhood <i>en route</i> for the country town. Some boys were the
      first to notice him, and at once they came running home with a horrifying
      tale of a great serpent or werewolf which was crouching in a hole. To this
      they added a statement that the said creature had pursued them, and come
      near to devouring Kuzka. From far and near the peasants armed themselves
      with hatchets and pitchforks, and proceeded to the ditch <i>en masse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither away?&rdquo; the old men said reprovingly. &ldquo;Are you mad? What do you
      want to do? Leave things alone, and no harm will come of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the peasants set forth, and, when about a hundred paces from
      the spot, began to adjure the monster in varying terms. But no answer was
      returned. Next, after halting a moment, the party advanced a little
      further. The man seemed still to be lying in the ditch, with his head
      resting against a fence, while beside him lay a satchel and a cudgel (on
      the latter of which was slung a pair of boots). Yet the peasants could not
      summon up the necessary courage to approach him or to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, friend!&rdquo; they shouted&mdash;one scratching his head and another the
      back of his neck. &ldquo;What are you doing there? Who are you? What&rsquo;s the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The traveller made as though to raise his head a little, but failed.
      Evidently he was ill or tired out. Then a peasant ventured to touch him
      with a pitchfork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interfere with him, don&rsquo;t interfere with him!&rdquo; cried the rest. &ldquo;How
      do we know what he is, seeing that he refuses to speak? Leave him alone,
      friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we had better go away,&rdquo; added certain others. &ldquo;What has <i>he</i> to
      do with us? Harm might come of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So all returned to the village, and told the elder men that, lying in a
      ditch, there was a strange man who would not speak, and whose identity was
      known only to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not belong to these parts, leave him alone,&rdquo; advised the
      elders from the spot where, with hands on knees, they were sitting resting
      on a bank. &ldquo;Yes, leave him to himself. &rsquo;Tis no use <i>your</i>
      going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the corner of the world whither Oblomov passed in his
      sleep. Of the three or four scattered villages in the region, one was
      named Sosnovka, and a second Vavilovka&mdash;the two being distant from
      one another about a verst. Together they constituted Oblomov&rsquo;s hereditary
      estate, and bore the joint title of Oblomovka. In Sosnovka stood the
      manor-house and the farm, while five versts from the village there lay the
      hamlet of Verklevo&mdash;once the property of the Oblomovs, but long since
      passed into other hands. The same hamlet had attached to it a number of
      outlying huts. As a whole, Verklevo belonged to a rich landowner, a
      constant absentee, and the estate was managed by a German bailiff. There
      you have the geography of this remote corner of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov dreamed that, aged seven, he awoke in his little cot at home. He
      felt merry and full of life. What a goodly, handsome, plump youngster he
      was, with cheeks of such rotundity that, however desperately any other
      young scamp might have tried to rival them by inflation of his own, no
      competitor could possibly have succeeded. Oblomov&rsquo;s nurse had long been
      waiting for him to awake, and now she began to draw on for him his
      stockings. This he refused to allow her to do; which end he attained by
      frisking and kicking, while she tried to catch hold of his leg, and the
      pair laughed joyously together. Finally, she lifted him on to her lap, and
      washed him, and combed his hair; after which she conducted him to his
      mother. On seeing his long-dead parent, the sleeping Oblomov&rsquo;s form
      trembled with delight and affection, and from under his unconscious
      eyelids there stole and remained two burning tears....
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon him his mother showered affectionate kisses, and gazed at him with
      tender solicitude to see whether his eyes were clear and healthy. Did he
      in any way ail? she inquired. Had he (tiffs to his nurse) slept quietly,
      or had he lain awake all night? Had he had any dreams? Had he been at all
      feverish? Lastly, she took him by the hand, and led him to the sacred <i>ikon</i>.
      Kneeling with one arm around his form, she prompted him in the words of
      the prayers, while the boy repeated them with scanty attention, since he
      preferred, rather, to turn his eyes to the windows, whence the freshness
      and scent of a lilac-tree was flooding the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go for a walk to-day, mamma?&rdquo; suddenly he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling,&rdquo; she replied hastily, but kept her gaze fixed upon the <i>ikon</i>,
      and hurriedly concluded the sacred formula. Yet into the words of that
      formula her very soul was projected, whereas the little one repeated them
      only in nonchalant fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayer over, they went to greet his father, and then to take morning
      tea. Beside the table Oblomov could see seated the aunt of eighty who had
      always lived with them. Never did she cease to grumble at the ancient
      serving-maid who, her head trembling with senility, stood behind her chair
      to wait upon her. Also there were present three old maiden ladies who were
      distant relatives of his father&rsquo;s; a weak-minded gentleman named
      Chekmenev, who, the brother-in-law of Oblomov&rsquo;s mother, was the owner of
      seven serfs, and happened to be staying with Oblomov&rsquo;s parents; and
      certain other old men and women. The latter, the domestic staff and
      retinue of the Oblomov family, caught hold of the little Ilya Ilyitch, and
      started to heap him with caresses and attentions&mdash;so much so that he
      had much ado to wipe away the traces of these unsought kisses. Then there
      began the feeding of the child with rolls, biscuits, and cream; after
      which his mother bestowed upon him another embrace, and sent him out to
      walk round the garden and the courtyard and the lake&mdash;accompanying
      her farewell with particular instructions to the nurse that never must she
      leave the child alone for a single moment, nor yet must she allow him to
      approach the horses, the dogs, or the goat, nor yet must she take him far
      from home. Above all things, never must the nurse suffer him to approach
      the ravine, which was the most dreaded spot in the neighbourhood, and bore
      an evil reputation. Once there had been found there a dog which confessed
      itself a mad one, inasmuch as it had run headlong from folk who chased it
      with hatchets and pitchforks, and had disappeared behind a neighbouring
      hill. Likewise to the ravine carrion was carted, while robbers and wolves
      and various other creatures which never existed in the world at all were
      supposed to dwell there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to these warnings of his mother&rsquo;s the child paid little heed. Already
      he was outside, in the courtyard. With gleeful surprise (as though for the
      first time in his life) he went the round of his parents&rsquo; establishment,
      with its gates sagging outwards, its dinted roof where lichen grew, its
      tottering veranda, its various annexes and outbuildings, and its overgrown
      garden. Also he yearned to ascend to the hanging gallery which girdled the
      house, that thence he might see the river; but the gallery was now in
      decay, and scarcely able to hold together, so that none but the servants
      trod it, and at no time did the gentry walk there. Heedless of his
      mother&rsquo;s warnings, however, the little Oblomov was on the point of making
      for its seductive steps when the nurse showed herself on the veranda, and
      caught hold of him. Next, he rushed from her towards the hay-loft, with
      the intention of scaling its steep ladder; and just had she time to
      destroy successive schemes of ascending to the pigeon-cote, of penetrating
      to the cattle-yard, and&mdash;Heaven preserve us all!&mdash;of making his
      way to the ravine!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless the child!&rdquo; exclaimed the nurse. &ldquo;<i>Will</i> you be quiet,
      then, young sir? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo; Indeed, the whole
      day, as well as every day and every night, was spent by her in similar
      alarums and excursions, in alternations of torture and relief on the
      child&rsquo;s account, in terror because he had fallen and broken his nose, in
      gratification at his warm, childish caresses, and in dim anxiety
      concerning his ultimate future. Only these and like emotions made her old
      heart beat and her old blood grow warm; only these retained in her the
      drowsy life which, but for them, would long ago have flickered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the child was not always mischievous. Sometimes he would grow suddenly
      quiet as, sitting beside her, he gazed fixedly before him with his
      childish intellect taking in the various phenomena which presented
      themselves to his vision. Such phenomena were sinking fast into his mind,
      to grow and ripen there even as it grew and ripened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was a splendid one, and the air still fresh, since the sun had
      not yet attained much height. From the house, from the trees, from the
      dovecote, and from the gallery there streamed long shadows which formed,
      in the garden and in the orchard, cool corners which invited meditation
      and sleep. Only in the distance a rye-held was glowing with flame, and the
      river sparkling and flashing in the rays of the sun until actually it hurt
      the eyes to look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it so dark in one place and bright in another?&rdquo; asked the child.
      &ldquo;Will it soon be bright everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is because the sun has come out to meet the moon, and at times
      keeps frowning because he cannot catch sight of her. By and by he <i>will</i>
      catch sight of her. Then he will send out his light once more.&rdquo; The child
      pondered, and gazed at the scene around him. Before him he could see Antip
      driving the watercart, with another Antip, ten times as large as the real
      one, accompanying him, and the barrel of the cart looking as large as a
      house, and the horse&rsquo;s shadow covering the whole of the pond. Then the
      shadows seemed to take two strides across the pond, and then to move
      behind the hill, though the figure of Antip had not yet left the
      courtyard. In his turn the child took a couple of strides, and then a
      third, to see if he too would end by disappearing behind the hill, which
      he had a great longing to ascend, for the purpose of ascertaining what had
      become of the horse. Consequently he set on towards the gates but only to
      hear his mother calling from a window&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse, nurse, do you not see that the boy has just run out into the
      sunshine? Pray bring him back into the shade, or he will get a sunstroke,
      and be ill, and sick, and unable to eat! Besides, he might run down into
      the ravine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the naughty darling!&rdquo; the nurse muttered to herself as she dragged
      him back on to the veranda. The child looked about him with the keen,
      observant glance of a &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; who is debating how best a morning can be
      spent. Not a trifle, not a circumstance, escaped the child&rsquo;s inquisitive
      attention, so that insensibly the picture of his home life engraved itself
      upon his mind, and his sensitive intellect nourished itself on living
      examples, and involuntarily modelled its programme of life on the life
      which surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never at any time could it be said that the <i>morning</i> was wasted in
      the Oblomovs&rsquo; establishment. The sound of knives in the kitchen, as they
      minced cutlets and vegetables, reached even to the village; while from the
      servants&rsquo; quarters came the hum of a spindle, coupled with the thin, low
      voice of an old woman&mdash;but a voice so low that with difficulty could
      one distinguish whether she were weeping, or whether she were merely
      improvising to herself a mournful &ldquo;song without words.&rdquo; Also, on Antip
      returning with the watercart, there would advance to meet it, with pails,
      cans, and pitchers, a number of maidservants and grooms, while from the
      storehouse an old woman would produce a vessel of meal and a pile of eggs,
      and carry them to the kitchen. There, on the cook suddenly throwing some
      water out of the window, the cat Arapka&mdash;which, with eyes fixed upon
      the view, had spent the morning in agitating the tip of her tail and
      licking herself&mdash;came in for a splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the family, too, was not idle, for he spent the morning in
      sitting by the window and following with his eyes everything which took
      place in the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, Ignashka, what have you there, you rascal?&rdquo; he cried to a man who
      happened to cross the open space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some knives to be sharpened in the scullery,&rdquo; the man replied, without
      looking at his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Mind you sharpen them properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, the master stopped one of the maidservants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are <i>you</i> going?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the cellar to get some milk for the table,&rdquo; she replied, shading her
      eyes with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;And see that you don&rsquo;t spill any. You, Zakharka&mdash;where
      are <i>you</i> off to once more? This is the third time I have seen you
      gadding about. Go back to your place in the hall.&rdquo; Whereupon Zakharka
      returned to her day-dreams at the post mentioned. Again, as soon as the
      cows returned from pasture, old Oblomov was always there to see that they
      were properly watered. Also, when, from his post at the window, he chanced
      to observe the yard-dog chasing one of the hens he hastened to take the
      necessary measures against a recurrence of such conduct. In the same way,
      his wife was fully employed. For three hours she discussed with Averka,
      the tailor, the best ways and means of converting a waistcoat of her
      husband&rsquo;s into a jacket for her son&mdash;herself drawing the requisite
      lines in chalk, and seeing to it that Averka should pilfer not a morsel of
      the cloth. Thereafter she passed to the maids&rsquo; room, where she parcelled
      cut to each damsel the day&rsquo;s portion of lacemaking; whence she departed to
      summon one of her personal maids to attend her in the garden, for the
      purpose of seeing how the apples were swelling, which of them had fallen
      or were turning ripe, which trees wanted grafting or pruning, and so
      forth. But her chief care was the kitchen and the dinner. Concerning the
      latter she consulted the entire household, including the aged aunt. Each
      member of the family proposed a special dish, and the sum of these
      proposals was taken into consideration, adjudicated upon in detail, and
      adopted or rejected according to the final decision of the mistress. From
      time to time, also, a maid was dispatched to the culinary regions to
      remind the cook of this, or to tell her to add that, or to instruct her to
      change the other, while conveying to her sugar, honey, and wine for
      flavouring, and also seeing to it that the said cook was using everything
      which had been measured out. In fact, the supervision of food was the
      first and the principal domestic preoccupation of Oblomovka.
    </p>
    <p>
      What calves were not fattened for the year&rsquo;s festivals! What poultry was
      not reared! What forethought and care and skill were not devoted to the
      consumption of comestibles! Game fowls and pullets were set apart solely
      for birthdays and other solemn occasions; wherefore they were stuffed with
      nuts. For the same reason geese were caught several days beforehand, and
      hung up in bags until wanted, in order that, being restrained from
      exercise, they might put on the more fat. And what a roasting and a
      pickling and a baking would sometimes take place, and what mead and <i>kvass</i>
      * were there not brewed, and what pies were there not compounded!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  A liquor made from fermented bread crusts or fruit.
</pre>
    <p>
      Until noon, therefore, everything at Oblomovka was in a state of bustle
      and commotion. Life was indeed full and antlike and in evidence! Even on
      Sundays and holidays these labour-loving ants did not desist from their
      toil, for on such days the clatter of knives in the kitchen sounded louder
      and more rapid than ever, a maid made several journeys from the storeroom
      to the kitchen with double quantities of meal and eggs, and in the
      poultry-run an added amount of cackling and of bloodshed took place.
      Likewise, on such days there was baked a gigantic pie, which was eaten by
      the gentry on the same and the following days, and by the maids on the
      third and fourth; after which, should it survive to the fifth clay, the
      last stale remnants, devoid of stuffing, were given, as a special favour,
      to Antip, who, crossing himself, undauntedly attacked the rock-hard
      fragments&mdash;though it was in the thought that it had recently been the
      gentry&rsquo;s pie rather than in the pie itself that he took most delight; even
      as an archaeologist rejoices to drink even the poorest wine from the shell
      of a thousand-year-old vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the boy noted with his childish, ever-watchful mind. He perceived
      that, after mornings thus usefully and busily spent, there ensued noon and
      dinner. On the present occasion noontide was sultry, and not a cloud was
      in the sky. Indeed, the sun seemed to be standing still to scorch the
      grass, and the ah to have ceased to circulate&mdash;to be hanging without
      the slightest movement. Neither from tree nor lake could the faintest
      rustle be heard, and over the village and the countryside there hung an
      unbroken stillness, as though everything in them were dead. Only from afar
      could a human voice be distinguished, while, some twenty <i>sazhens</i> *
      away, the drone of a flying beetle, with the snoring of some one who had
      sunk into the thick herbage to enjoy a refreshing sleep, came gently to
      the ear. Even the house was possessed by a silence as of death, for the
      hour of post-prandial slumber had arrived. The boy&rsquo;s father, mother, and
      aged grandaunt, with their attendants, could be seen disposed in various
      corners; and, should any one not possess a particular corner, he or she
      repaired either to the hay-loft or to the garden or to a cool
      resting-place among the growing hay or, with face protected from the flies
      with a handkerchief, to a spot where the scorching heat would assist
      digestion after the enormous dinner. Even the gardener stretched himself
      out beneath a bush by the side of his plot, and the coachman in the
      stable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Little Oblomov proceeded to peep into the servants&rsquo; hall, where the
      inmates were sleeping as though slumber had become an epidemic. On the
      benches, on the floor, and on the threshold they slept, while their
      children crawled about the courtyard and fashioned mud pies. Indeed, the
      very dogs had crawled into their kennels, since there was no longer any
      one to bark at. In short, one might have traversed the entire
      establishment without meeting a single soul; and everything in it could
      with ease have been stolen, and removed in carts from the courtyard, since
      no one would have been there to prevent the deed. The prevailing lethargy
      was all-consuming, all-conquering&mdash;a true image of death; seeing
      that, but for the fact that from various corners there came snores in
      different notes and keys, every one seemed wholly to have departed this
      life. Only at rare intervals would some one raise his head with a start,
      gaze around him with vacant eyes, and then turn over to the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the child accompanied his nurse for a second airing out of
      doors. Yet, despite her mistress&rsquo;s injunctions and her own resolves, the
      old woman could not altogether resist the general call of sleep, and began
      to fall a victim to the all-prevalent malady of Oblomovka. At first she
      kept a vigilant eye upon her little charge, and, chiding him for his
      waywardness, never let him stray from her side; but presently, after
      giving him strict instructions not to go beyond the gates, nor to
      interfere with the goat, nor to climb either the dovecote or the gallery,
      she settled herself in a shady spot, with the ostensible intention of at
      once knitting a stocking and of watching over young Oblomov. Next she took
      to checking him only in lazy fashion, as her head nodded and she said to
      herself: &ldquo;Look you, he will certainly climb those stairs to the gallery,
      or else&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes had almost closed&mdash;&ldquo;he will run down into the
      ravine.&rdquo; With that her head sank forward, and the stocking slipped from
      her hands. In a second her open mouth had emitted a gentle snore, and the
      boy had disappeared from her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, this was the moment which the youngster had been
      impatiently awaiting, for it marked the beginning of an independent
      existence, and he was now alone in the wide, wide world. On tiptoe he left
      the nurse&rsquo;s side, and, peeping cautiously at the other slumberers, kept
      stopping to throw a second glance at any one who chanced to stir, or to
      spit, or to snuffle in his sleep. At last, with a tremor of joy in his
      heart, he made for the gallery, ascended the creaking stairs at a run,
      scaled also the dovecote, explored the recesses of the garden, listened to
      the buzzing of beetles, and followed with his eyes their flight through
      the air. Next, on hearing a chirping sound in the grass, he sought and
      captured the disturber of the public peace, in the shape of a dragon-fly,
      whose wings he proceeded to tear off, and whose body to impale upon a
      straw, in order that he might see how, thus hampered, the creature would
      contrive to fly. Afterwards, fearing almost to breathe, he watched a
      spider suck blood from a captured fly, while the wretched victim struggled
      and buzzed in the spider&rsquo;s claws. Finally the tragedy was brought to an
      end by the boy slaying both torturer and tortured. Next, he repaired to
      the moat to search for sundry small roots which he knew of; which found,
      he peeled them, and then devoured the same with relish, in the
      make-believe that they were the apples and preserves which his mamma was
      accustomed to give him. This item exhausted, he hied him through the
      entrance gates&mdash;his object in so doing being to reach a birch copse
      which looked to him so close at hand that, should he take the direct
      route, and not the circuitous high-road (that is to say, should he walk
      straight across the moat, and through the osier plantation), he would be
      able to attain his goal in five minutes. But, alas! he felt afraid, for he
      had heard tales of wood goblins, of brigands, and of fearsome wild beasts.
      Next, the spirit moved him to make for the ravine, which lay a hundred
      paces from the garden; so, running to the edge of the declivity, and
      puckering his eyes, he gazed into its depths as into Vulcan&rsquo;s crater.
      Suddenly to his mind recurred all the tales and traditions concerning the
      spot; and terror seized him. and, half-dead, half-alive, he rushed back
      and threw himself into his nurse&rsquo;s arms. Awakened, she sprang up,
      straightened the cap on her head, arranged her grey curls with one finger,
      and pretended never to have been to sleep at all. Glancing suspiciously at
      the little Ilya, and then at the gentry&rsquo;s windows, she began with
      tremulous hands to work the knitting needles of the stocking which had
      been lying in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the heat had decreased, and everything in nature had revived a
      little since the sun was fast declining towards the forest. Gradually the
      stillness indoors also began to be broken. Here and there a door creaked,
      footsteps could be heard crossing the yard, and some one sneezed in the
      hay-loft. Soon from the kitchen a man came hurrying under the weight of a
      huge <i>samovar</i>, and the entire household then assembled for tea&mdash;one
      man with his face flushed and his eyes still dim, another man with red
      marks on his cheek and temple, a third speaking in a voice not his own for
      drowsiness, and all of them snuffling, wheezing, yawning, scratching their
      heads, and stretching themselves in a semiwaking condition. It seemed that
      dinner and sleep had combined to arouse an unquenchable thirst which
      parched the throat, for even dozens of cupfuls of tea could not assuage
      it, and, amid a chorus of sighs and grunts, resort had to be made to
      bilberry wine, to perry, to <i>kvass</i>, and even to more medicinal
      methods of moistening this avidity of gullet. The company sought relief
      from thirst as from a Heaven-sent plague, and all felt as exhausted as
      though they were travelling in the Arabian desert, and could nowhere find
      a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his mother&rsquo;s side the child gazed at the strange faces around him, and
      listened to the drowsy, drawling talk. Yet the spectacle delighted him,
      and he found each stray word interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea every one took up some minor occupation or another. One man
      repaired to the riverside, and strolled along the brink&mdash;kicking
      pebbles into the water as he did so. Another took a seat in a window, and
      followed with his eyes each passing occurrence. Should a cat cross the
      courtyard, or a jackdaw fly by, the watcher scanned both the one and the
      other, and turned his head to right and to left in order to do so. In the
      same way will dogs spend whole days at a window&mdash;their heads thrust
      into the sunlight, and their gaze taking stock of every passer-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother took little Ilya&rsquo;s head in her hands, drew it down into her
      lap, and combed his hair with a gentle caress as, inviting her maids to
      admire him, she talked concerning his future, and preordained for him the
      hero&rsquo;s part in some splendid epic. For their part, the maids foretold for
      him mountains of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length dusk began to draw in. Once more the fire crackled in the
      kitchen, and the clatter of knives became audible. Supper was being
      prepared. Meanwhile the rest of the servants gathered at the entrance
      gates, and thence came sounds of laughter, and of music, and of the
      playing of <i>gorielki</i>. The sun had sunk behind the forest, yet still
      was sending forth rays in a fiery, faintly warm streak which, as it passed
      over the surface of the treetops, touched to gold the tips of the pines.
      Finally these rays successively expired, until only a solitary beam could
      be seen fixed, needle-like, in a cluster of boughs before going to join
      its comrades. Objects then began to lose their outline, and the scene to
      become blurred in, first greyness, then a blank almost of total obscurity.
      The songs of birds grew fainter, then ceased altogether, save for one
      persistent singer which, as though disagreeing with its fellows, continued
      to break the silence with intermittent warbling. Presently it too took to
      uttering its song at rarer intervals, ana to whistling with&rsquo; more feeble
      insistence; until finally it breathed a last soft-drawn note, gave a
      flutter or two which gently stirred the foliage around it, and&mdash;fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that all was silent, save that some crickets were chirping in chorus
      and against one another. A mist was rising from the earth, and spreading
      over lake and river. Like everything else, the latter had sunk to rest;
      and though something caused it to splash for a last time, the water
      instantly resumed its absolute immobility. In the air a dampness could be
      detected, and the air itself could be felt growing warmer and warmer. Amid
      it the trees looked like groups of monsters; and when, suddenly, something
      cracked in the weird depths of the forest, it might have been thought that
      one of those monsters had been shifting its position, and with its foot
      had snapped a dry bough in doing so. Overhead, the first star could be
      seen glowing like a living eye, while in the windows of the house were a
      few twinkling lights. The hour of nature&rsquo;s most solemn, all-embracing
      silence had arrived&mdash;the hour when the creative brain can work at its
      best, and when poetic thought seethes most ardently, and when the heart
      flames with the greatest heat of passion or with the greatest poignancy of
      grief&mdash;the hour when the cruel soul ripens to a maximum of strength
      and composure as it meditates evil&mdash;the hour when, at Oblomovka,
      every one settled down to a night of profound, calm restfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go for a walk,&rdquo; said little Ilya to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless the child!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;<i>How</i> could we go for a walk? It
      is now damp, and you would get your little feet wet. Besides, we should
      find it dreadful out of doors, for at this hour the wood goblin is abroad,
      and he carries off little boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what place does he carry them, and what is he like, and where does he
      live?&rdquo; asked the child; whereupon the mother gave full rein to her
      unbridled fancy. As she did so the child listened with blinking eyes;
      until at length, on sleep completely overcoming him, the nurse approached,
      took him from his mother&rsquo;s lap, and bore him to bed, with his head hanging
      over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another day is over, praise be to God!&rdquo; said the inmates of Oblomovka as,
      yawning, they made the sign of the cross and then retired to rest. &ldquo;Well
      spent it has been, and God send that to-morrow be like it. Glory, O Lord,
      to Thee this night! Glory, O Lord, to Thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov dreamed a second dream. On a long winter&rsquo;s evening he was pressing
      close to his nurse, and she was whispering of some unknown country where
      neither cold nor darkness were known, and where miracles took place, and
      where rivers ran honey and milk, and where no one did anything the year
      round, and where only good boys like Ilya Ilyitch himself walked day by
      day in company with maidens such as neither tongue nor pen could hope to
      describe. Also (the nurse said) there dwelt there a kind witch who
      sometimes revealed herself to mortals in the shape of a pikefish; and this
      witch singled out as her especial favourite a quiet, inoffensive boor who
      formerly had been the butt of his fellows, and, for some unknown reason,
      heaped him with her bounty, so that always he possessed plenty to eat, and
      clothes ever ready to wear, and ended by marrying a marvellous beauty
      whose name was Militrissa Kirbitievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse related the story, and the child, with alert eyes and ears, hung
      upon her words. So artfully did the nurse or tradition eliminate from the
      story all resemblance to everyday life that the boy&rsquo;s keen intellect and
      imagination, fired by the device, remained enthralled until, in later
      years, he had come even to man&rsquo;s estate. As a matter of fact, the tale
      which the nurse thus lovingly related was the legend of the fool Emel&mdash;that
      clever, biting satire upon our forefathers and, it may be, also upon
      ourselves. True, in proportion as he grew up, little Oblomov came to learn
      that no such things as rivers of honey and milk, or even such persons as
      kind witches, really existed; yet, though he came to smile at his nurse&rsquo;s
      stories, that smile was never wholly sincere, since always it would be
      accompanied by a sigh. For him the legend confounded itself with life,
      and, unconsciously, he found himself regretting that the legend differed
      from life, and that life differed from the legend. Involuntarily he would
      dream of Militrissa Kirbitievna, and feel attracted towards the country
      whereof nothing was known except that folk there went for walks, and were
      free from sorrow and care. Never could he rid himself of a longing to
      spend his days in lying upon the stove (even as the favourite of the
      legend had done), and to be dressed in ready-made, unearned clothes, and
      to eat at the expense of a benevolent witch. To the same story had his
      father and his grandfather listened as, shaped according to the
      stereotyped version current throughout antiquity, it had issued from the
      mouths of male and female nurses through the long course of ages and of
      generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Oblomov&rsquo;s nurse proceeded to draw another picture for the imagination
      of her charge. That is to say, she told him of the exploits of the Russian
      Achilleses and Ulysseses, and of the manner in which those heroes had been
      used to wander about Russia, and to kill and slay; and of how once they
      had disputed as to which of them could best drain a beaker of wine at a
      draught. Also, she told the boy of cruel robbers, of sleeping princesses,
      and of cities and peoples which had been turned into stone. Lastly, she
      passed to Russian demonology, to dead folk, to monsters, and to
      werewolves. With a simplicity, yet a sincerity, worthy of Homer, with a
      lifelike similitude of detail and a power of clear-cut relief that might
      have vied with the great Greek poet&rsquo;s, she fired the boy&rsquo;s intellect and
      imagination to a love for that Iliad which our heroes founded during the
      dim ages when man had not yet become adapted to the sundry perils and
      mysteries of nature and of life&mdash;when still he trembled before
      werewolves and wood demons, and sought refuge with protectors like Alesha
      Popovitch from the calamities which surrounded him&mdash;when air and
      water and forest and held alike were under the continued sway of the
      supernatural. Truly, the life of a mortal of those days must have been
      full of fear and trembling, seeing that, should he but cross his
      threshold, he stood in danger of being devoured by a wild beast, or of
      having his throat cut by a brigand, or of being despoiled of his all by a
      Tartar, or of disappearing from human ken without trace left! Again,
      celestial portents would be seen in the shape cf pillars and balls of
      fire, while over a freshly made grave a light would glow, and some one
      would seem to be walking through the forest with a lantern, and laughing
      horribly, and flashing bright eyes amid the gloom: And in man&rsquo;s own
      personality much that passed his understanding would also take shape and
      materialize. No matter how long or how righteously a man might have lived,
      he would suddenly start babbling, or shout aloud in a voice not his own,
      or go wandering o&rsquo; nights in a trance, or involuntarily begin beating and
      assaulting his fellows. And just at the moment when such things happened a
      hen would crow like a cock, and a raven would croak from the gable!
      Consequently feeble mankind, peering tremblingly at life, sought in its
      own imagination, its own nature, a key to the mysteries which surrounded
      it: and it may be that the immobility, the inertia, the absence of all
      active passion or incident or peril which such a retired existence imposed
      upon man led him to create, in the midst of the world of nature, another
      and an impossible world, in which he found comfort and relief for his idle
      intellect, explanations of the more ordinary&rsquo; sequences of events, and
      extraneous solutions of extraordinary phenomena. In fact, our poor
      forefathers lived by instinct. Neither wholly giving rein to nor wholly
      restraining their volition, they found themselves either naïvely surprised
      at or overcome with terror by the evils and the misfortunes which befell
      them, and resorted for the causes of these things to the dim, dumb
      hieroglyphics of nature. In their opinion, death might come of carrying a
      corpse from a house head foremost instead of with feet in front, and a
      fire be caused by the fact of a dog having howled, three nights running,
      beneath a window. Hence always they were at pains to remove a dead person
      feet foremost&mdash;though continuing to eat the same quantity of food as
      before, and to sleep on the bare ground; while, with regard to a howling
      dog, always they drove away the animal with blows&mdash;though continuing
      to scatter sparks broadcast over tinder-dry floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day the Russian, though surrounded by a stern, unimaginative world
      of reality, loves to believe the seductive talcs of antiquity. And long
      will it be before he will have been weaned from that belief. In the same
      way, as little Oblomov listened to his nurse&rsquo;s legends concerning the
      Golden Fleece, the great Cassowary Bird, and the cells and secret dungeons
      of the Enchanted Castle, he became more and more fired to the idea that he
      too was destined to become the hero of doughty deeds. Tale succeeded to
      tale, and the nurse pursued her narrative with such ardour and vividness
      and attractiveness of description that at times her breath choked in her
      throat. For she too half-believed the legends which she related; so that,
      during the telling of them, her eyes would shoot fire, her head shake with
      excitement, and her voice attain an unwonted pitch, while the child,
      overcome with mysterious horror, would press closer and closer to her
      side, and have tears in his eyes. Whether the narrative treated of dead
      men rising from the tomb at midnight, or of victims languishing in slavery
      to a monster, or of a bear with a wooden leg which went roaming the
      villages and farms in search of the natural limb which had been chopped
      from its body, the boy&rsquo;s hair bristled with fear, his childish imagination
      alternately seethed and froze, and he experienced the harassing, the
      sickly sweet, process of having his nerves played upon like the strings of
      an instrument. When his nurse repeated the words of the bear, &ldquo;Creak,
      creak, wooden leg! I have visited every village and farm, and have found
      all the women asleep save one, who is now sitting on my back, and searing
      my flesh, and weaving my coat into cloth;&rdquo; when, also, the bear entered
      the right hut, and was just getting ready to pounce upon the true ravisher
      of his natural leg&mdash;why, then the boy could stand it no longer, but,
      trembling and whimpering, flung himself into his nurse&rsquo;s arms with tears
      of terror&mdash;yet also with a laugh of joy to think that <i>he</i> was
      not in the clutches of the bear, but sitting on the stove couch beside his
      old guardian. Full of strange phantoms was his mind, and fear and grief
      had sunk deep (and, possibly, for ever) into his soul. Mournfully he gazed
      about him, and saw that everything in life was charged with evil and
      misfortune. And as he did so he would keep thinking of the magic country
      where neither cruelty nor noise nor grief existed, and where Militrissa
      Kirbitievna lived, and where folk were fed and clothed for nothing....
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only over the Oblomovkan children, but also over the Oblomovkan
      adults, did this legend exercise a lifelong sway. Every one in the house
      and the village alike&mdash;from the <i>barin</i> and his wife down to the
      blacksmith Tarass&mdash;became a trifle nervous as evening drew on, seeing
      that at that hour every tree became transformed into a giant, and every
      bush into a robbers&rsquo; den. The rattle of a shutter, the howl of the wind in
      the chimney, caused these folk to turn pale. At Epiphany-tide not a man or
      a woman of them would go out of doors after ten o&rsquo;clock at night; and
      never during the season of Easter would any one venture o&rsquo; nights into the
      stable, lest there he should be confronted by the <i>domovoi</i>, by the
      horse demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oblomovka <i>everything</i> was believed in&mdash;including even ghosts
      and werewolves. Had you informed an inmate of the place that a haycock was
      walking about in the fields, he would have believed it. Had you spread
      abroad a rumour that (say) a certain sheep was not a sheep at all, but
      something else, or that Martha or Stepanida had become turned into a
      witch, the company would thenceforth have walked in terror both of the
      sheep and of the maidservant. Never would their heads have thought it
      necessary to inquire <i>why</i> the sheep had ceased to be a sheep, or <i>why</i>
      Martha or Stepanida had become turned into a witch. Rather these credulous
      folk would have thrown themselves upon any doubter&mdash;so strong was
      Oblomovka&rsquo;s belief in supernatural phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, little Oblomov came to see that the world is ordered on a simple
      plan, and that dead folk never rise from the tomb, and that no sooner do
      giants appear than they are clapped into booths, as robbers are cast into
      prison: yet, though his actual belief in such marvels vanished, there
      remained behind a sediment of terror and of unaccountable sadness. Nothing
      was to be apprehended from monsters&mdash;that he knew full well; but
      always he stood in awe of something which seemed to be awaiting him at
      every step; and, if left alone in a dark room, or if fated to catch sight
      of a corpse, he would tremble with that sense of oppressive foreboding
      which his infancy had instilled into his very being. Inclined, of a
      morning, to laugh at his fears, of an evening Lis countenance paled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next dream Oblomov saw himself a boy of thirteen or fourteen. By
      this time he was going to school at the village of Verkievo, five versts
      from Oblomovka, where an old German named Schtoltz kept a small
      educational establishment for the sons of neighbouring gentry. Schtoltz
      had a son of his own&mdash;one Andrei, a boy almost of the same age as
      Oblomov; while likewise he had been given charge of a boy who did few
      lessons, for the reason that he suffered from scrofula and was accustomed
      to spend most of his days with his eyes and ears bandaged, and weeping
      quietly because he was not living with his grandmother, but, rather, in a
      strange house and amid hardhearted folk who never petted him or baked him
      his favourite pies. These three boys constituted the only pupils. As for
      the tutor himself, he was both capable and strict&mdash;like most Germans;
      wherefore Oblomov might have received a good education had Oblomovka stood
      <i>five hundred</i> versts from Verklevo. As it was, the atmosphere, the
      mode of life, and the customs of Oblomovka extended also to Verklevo, and
      the one place represented a sort of replica of the other, until only old
      Schtoltz&rsquo;s establishment stood clear of the primordial mist of laziness,
      of simplicity of morals, of inertia, and of immobility for which Oblomovka
      was distinguished. With the scenes, the incidents, and the morals of that
      mode of life young Oblomov&rsquo;s mind and heart had become saturated before
      even he had seen his first book. Who knows how early the growth of the
      intellectual germ in the youthful brain begins? Can we, in that youthful
      consciousness, follow the growth of first impressions and ideas? Possibly,
      even before a child has learnt to speak, or even to walk, or even to do
      more than to look at things with the dumb, fixed gaze which his elders
      call &ldquo;dull,&rdquo; it has already discerned and envisaged the meaning, the
      inter-connection, of such phenomena as encompass its sphere&mdash;and that
      though the child is still powerless to communicate the fact, whether to
      itself or to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for a long time past young Oblomov may have remarked and understood
      what was being said and done in his presence; for a long time past he may
      have understood why his father, in plush breeches and a wadded,
      cinnamon-coloured coat, walked to and fro with his hands behind his back,
      and took snuff, and sneezed, while his mother passed from coffee to tea,
      and from tea to dinner, in the daily round, and his father always refused
      to believe how many sheaves had been cut and reaped, but was for ever
      looking out for derelictions of duty, and, a handkerchief in his hand,
      holding forth on the subject of irregularities, and turning the whole
      place upside down. Briefly, for a long time past the boy may have decided
      in his mind that that, and no other, order of life was the right one. For
      how else could he have decided? In what manner did the &ldquo;grown-ups&rdquo; of
      Oblomovka live? God only knows whether they ever asked themselves for what
      purpose life had been given them. Did they, at all events, return
      themselves any answer to that question? No, no answer at all, since the
      whole thing seemed to them at once simple and clear. Had they, then, never
      heard of a hard life wherein people walk with anxious hearts, and roam the
      face of the earth, and devote their existence to everlasting toil? No, the
      good folk of Oblomovka had no belief in disturbing the mind; they never
      adopted as their mode of life a round of ceaseless aspirations
      somewhither, and towards an indefinite end. In fact, they feared the
      distraction of passion as they did fire; and as, in other spheres, men&rsquo;s
      and women&rsquo;s bodies burn with the volcanic violence of inward and spiritual
      flame, so the souls of the denizens of Oblomovka lay plunged in an
      undisturbed inertia which possessed their ease-loving organisms to the
      core. Consequently, life did not stamp them, as it stamped others, with
      premature wrinkles; nor did it deal out to them any morally destructive
      blows or misfortunes. These good-humoured folk looked upon life as,
      rather, an idyll of peace and inactivity&mdash;though an idyll
      occasionally broken by such untoward incidents as sicknesses, losses,
      quarrels, and rare bouts of labour. That labour they endured as a
      punishment formerly imposed upon their forefathers also; yet they never
      loved it, and invariably escaped its incidence whenever they found it
      possible so to do. Such an avoidance they considered permissible, for
      never did they worry themselves with vague moral or intellectual
      questions. In this manner they flourished in constant health and
      cheerfulness: for which reason most of them lived to a green old age. Men
      of forty would look like youths, and old men, instead of battling with the
      approach of a hard and painful end, lived to the utmost possible limit,
      and then died, as it were, unawares, and with a gentle chilling of the
      frame, and an imperceptible drawing of the closing breath. No wonder that
      in these days folk say that the people used to be more robust!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it <i>was</i> more robust, for the reason that in those days parents
      did not hurry to explain to a boy the meaning of life, and to prepare him
      for life as for something at once difficult and solemn. No, they did not
      weary a child with books which would cloud his head with questions likely
      to devour the heart and the intellect, and to shorten existence. Rather,
      the standard of life was furnished him and taught him by parents who had
      received it ready-made from <i>their</i> parents, together with a
      testamentary injunction to preserve the integrity, the inviolability of
      that standard as they would have done that of the Vestal flame. As things
      were done in the time of Oblomovkan fathers and grandfathers, so were they
      done in the time of the present Oblomov&rsquo;s tenure of the estate. Of what
      needed he to think? Concerning what needed he to trouble his head? What
      needed he to learn? What ends needed he to compass? The Oblomovs required
      nothing&mdash;their life flowed like a peaceful river, and all that they
      had to do was to sit on the bank of that river, and to observe the
      inevitable phenomena which, successively, and unsought, presented
      themselves to the eyes of each observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the vision of the steeping Oblomov there next uprose a series of
      living pictures of the three chief acts of Oblomovkan life, as played in
      the presence of his family, of his relatives, and of his friends&mdash;namely,
      the three acts of birth, of marriage, and of death. This was succeeded by
      a varied procession of minor incidents of life, whether grave or gay&mdash;of
      baptisms, birthdays, family festivals, Shrovetides, Easters, Convivial
      feasts, family gatherings, welcomes, farewells, and occasions of official
      congratulation or condolence. These passed before Oblomov&rsquo;s vision with
      solemn exactitude, and also he beheld the bearing of familiar faces at
      these ceremonies, according as they were affected by vanity or by care. No
      matter what the festival might be&mdash;whether a betrothal or a solemn
      wedding or a name-day&mdash;every possible social rule had to be
      consulted, and no mistake made as to where each person was to sit, what
      presents, and to what value, ought to be given, who was to walk with whom
      at the ceremony, and what signals had best be made during its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think, then, that goodly children would not result from such formal
      unitings? For answer you would need but to look at the rosy, heavy little
      cupids which the mothers of the place carried or led by the hand. Every
      one of those mothers would have insisted that their little ones were the
      plumpest, the whitest, and the healthiest children possible. Another local
      custom was to make a lark-pie as soon as spring came in. Without it spring
      would not have been spring at all, for observances of this kind comprised
      the whole life, the whole scientific knowledge, of the inhabitants, all of
      whose joys and sorrows were bound up with Oblomovka, and whose hearts beat
      high at the anticipation of such local rites and feasts and ceremonies.
      Yet no sooner had they christened, married, or buried an individual than
      they forgot both the latter and his (or her) fate, and relapsed into their
      usual apathy until aroused by a new occasion&mdash;by a baptism, a
      wedding, or other happening of the kind. Directly a child was born the
      parents made it their first care to perform over the little one every
      ceremony prescribed by decorum, and then to follow up the christening with
      a banquet. Thereafter the child&rsquo;s bringing up began according to a system
      dictated by the mother and the nurse for his healthy development, and for
      his protection from cold, from the evil eye, and from sundry other
      inimical influences. Indeed, no pains were spared to keep the youngster in
      good appetite and spirits. Also as soon as he was able to fend for
      himself, and a nurse had become a superfluity, his mother would be seized
      with a desire to procure for him a helpmeet as strong and as ruddy as
      himself; whereupon there would ensue a further epoch of rites and
      feastings, until eventually a marriage had been arranged. Always this
      consummation represented the epitome of life&rsquo;s incidents, and as soon as
      it was reached there began a repetition of births, rites, and banquets,
      until, finally, a funeral ceremony interrupted the festivities&mdash;though
      not for long, since other faces would appear to succeed the old ones, and
      children would become youths and maidens, and plight their troth to one
      another, and marry one another, and produce individuals similar to
      themselves. Thus life stretched out in a continuous, uniform chain which
      broke off imperceptibly only when the tomb had been reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, the rare times when other cares overtook the good folk of Oblomovka,
      but always they faced the situation with stoical immobility, and the said
      cares, after circling over their heads, flew away like birds which, having
      sought to cling to a smooth, perpendicular wall, find that they are
      fluttering their wings in vain against the stubborn stone, and therefore
      spread those pinions and depart. For instance, on one occasion a portion
      of the gallery around the house fell upon, and buried under its ruins, a
      hencoop full of poultry, as well as, in doing so, narrowly missed a
      serving-woman who happened to be sitting near the spot with her husband.
      At once the establishment was in an uproar. Every one came running to the
      scene, under the impression that not only the hencoop, but also the <i>barinia</i>
      and little Ilya, were lying under the <i>debris</i>. Every one held up his
      or her hands in horror, and fell to blaming every one else for not having
      foreseen the catastrophe. Every one expressed surprise that the gallery
      had fallen, and also surprise that it had not fallen long ago. Upon that
      there ensued a clamour and a discussion as to how things could best be put
      right; after which, with sighs of regret for the poultry, the company
      slowly dispersed, while strictly forbidding little Ilya to approach the
      rums. Three weeks later Andrushka, Petrushka, and Vassika were ordered to
      chop the planks and the remainder of the balustrade in pieces, and then to
      remove the fragments to the outbuildings, lest the road should become
      obstructed; and in the outbuildings those fragments tossed about until the
      following spring. Every time that the elder Oblomov saw them from the
      window he fell to thinking, what had best be done with them. Summoning the
      carpenter, he took counsel with the man as to whether he had better build
      a new gallery or pull down what was left of the old one; until finally he
      dismissed his subordinate with the words, &ldquo;Do you wait a little until I
      have considered the matter further.&rdquo; The same thing went on until, one
      day, either Vassika or Motika reported to the <i>barin</i> that that
      morning, while he (Vassika or Motika) had been climbing over the remains
      of the old gallery, the corners of it had come away from the walls, and
      more of the structure had fallen; whereupon the carpenter was summoned to
      a final consultation, and the upshot was that some of the old fragments
      were used to prop the remaining portions of the gallery. Sure enough, by
      the close of the month this had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that gallery looks as good as new,&rdquo; the old man said to his wife.
      &ldquo;See how splendidly Thedot has re-erected the beams! They resemble the
      pillars which the Governor has just had fitted to his house. The job has
      been well done, and will last for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here some one reminded him that it would be as well also to have the gates
      rehung and the veranda repaired, since the holes in the steps to the
      latter were affording access, not only to the cats, but also to the pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, it <i>ought</i> to be done,&rdquo; said the <i>barin</i>
      thoughtfully. Then he went out to look at the veranda. &ldquo;Yes, certainly the
      thing is breaking up,&rdquo; he continued as he see-sawed one of the planks like
      a cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been loose ever since the veranda was made,&rdquo; some one remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked the <i>barin</i>. &ldquo;They are loose only because the floor
      has not been mended for sixteen years. It was done then by Luka. He <i>was</i>
      a carpenter, if you like! Now he is dead, may God rest his soul! Workmen
      are not as clever as they used to be&mdash;they merely spoil things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that old Oblomov turned his attention to something else; and to this
      day&mdash;so report has it&mdash;the veranda is rickety, though not
      actually fallen to pieces. Certainly Luka <i>must</i> have been a good
      workman!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to do the master and the mistress justice, they were capable of
      being shaken out of their apathy, even to the point of growing angry and
      heated, should any failure or misfortune occur. How, they would inquire,
      could such and such a matter have come to be overlooked or neglected? At
      once due measures must be taken. Perhaps this would be relative to the
      fact that the footbridge over the moat needed mending, or that the garden
      fence called for repairs at a spot where the planking was lying flat upon
      the ground and allowing the cattle to enter and spoil the shrubs. Indeed,
      so solicitous was the <i>barin</i> for his property that once, when
      walking in the garden, he, with his own hands, and with many grunts and
      groans, lifted up a length of fencing, and ordered the gardener to fix a
      couple of props to the same; and to this activity on the part of the
      proprietor was due the fact that the said fence remained upright during
      the whole of the remainder of the summer&mdash;until once more a winter
      snowstorm laid it low. Also, when Antip, with his horse and water-cart,
      fell through the bridge into the moat three new planks were inserted into
      the structure! Indeed, Antip had not recovered from his bruising before
      the bridge was looking almost as good as new! And even when the garden
      fence collapsed a second time the cows and the goats did not reap very
      much advantage from the event. True, they managed to devour a few
      currant-bushes, and also to strip a dozen lime-trees; but before they
      could begin also upon the apple-trees an order was issued that the fence
      should be properly dug in and reditched. But this was only after two cows
      and a goat had been caught redhanded. You should have seen the distension
      of their stomachs with the generous fare!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Oblomov dreamed that he was in the great, dark drawing-room at
      home. The long winter&rsquo;s evening was closing in, and his mother, seated on
      the sofa and engaged in quietly knitting a boy&rsquo;s stocking, was yawning
      occasionally, and scratching her head with a knitting-needle. Beside her
      were two maids&mdash;their heads bent over their work as industriously
      they fashioned a holiday garment either for young Ilya or for his father
      or for themselves. Meanwhile the <i>barin</i>, with hands clasped behind
      his back, was pacing cheerfully to and fro, or seating himself on a chair
      for a moment or two before resuming his walk. Ever and anon, too, he would
      take a pinch of snuff, sneeze, and then take another pinch. As for light,
      it came from a single tallow candle, and even the said candle was a luxury
      permitted only on autumn and winter evenings; for in summer every one
      contrived to rise and to go to bed by daylight, so that candles might be
      saved altogether. This was a practice which had arisen partly from custom
      and partly from economy. Of every commodity not produced at home, but
      requiring, rather, to be bought, the good folk of Oblomovka were extremely
      parsimonious; so that, although they would willingly slaughter a fine
      gamefowl or a dozen young pullets for a guest&rsquo;s entertainment, not a
      raisin too much would be put into a pudding, and every face would whiten
      if the said guest should pour himself out a second glassful of wine. Very
      seldom, however, did such <i>contretemps</i> occur: only the most
      abandoned of wretches would have done things like those&mdash;and guests
      of that kidney never obtained even admittance to Oblomovka. Local manners
      required that, what though twice or thrice invited to partake of a given
      dish or a given bottle of wine, the guest should <i>not</i> do so, since
      he was supposed to be aware that even the first invitation had conveyed a
      secret prayer that he would kindly abstain from the dish or bottle of wine
      after merely tasting of the same. Nor were two candles lit for every
      guest, since candles required to be bought in the town, and therefore,
      like all other purchased articles, were kept under lock and key by the
      lady of the house, and, with the candle-ends, were counted before being
      stored away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Oblomovka disliked disbursing hard cash; so much so that,
      however much a given article might be required, the money for it would be
      handed out with reluctance, however insignificant the sum. As for any <i>considerable</i>
      outlay, it was accompanied with groans, lamentations, and high words,
      since the Oblomovkans would suffer any kind of misfortune rather than part
      with their coin. For this reason the sofa in the drawing-room had long
      been in rags, and the leather on the <i>barin&rsquo;s</i> arm-chair leather only
      by courtesy, since most of its cord and rope stuffing was now exposed, and
      only a single strip of the original covering clung to the back of the
      chair&mdash;the rest having, during the past five years, become split into
      strips, and fallen away. For the same reason the entrance gates had
      sagged, and the veranda become rickety. Nevertheless, to pay out, say,
      from two to five hundred roubles for a given purpose, however necessary
      that purpose might be, seemed to the inhabitants of the establishment
      something almost approaching suicide. In fact, on hearing that a young
      landowner of the neighbourhood had gone to Moscow and there paid three
      hundred roubles for a dozen shirts, twenty-five for a pair of boots, and
      forty for a waistcoat (it was on the occasion of the landowner&rsquo;s
      marriage), old Oblomov crossed himself, and exclaimed with an expression
      of horror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man ought to be clapped into prison!&rdquo; In general, the
      Oblomovkans paid no heed to politico-economic axioms concerning the
      necessity of swift, brisk circulation of capital, or concerning the active
      production and exchange of commodities. In the simplicity of their souls
      they considered that the best theory, as well as the best practice, with
      regard to capital was to hoard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On chairs in the drawing-room there would be seated snoring, in different
      attitudes, the gentry and customary intimates of the house. For the most
      part a profound silence would reign among them, for they saw one another
      every day, and their respective stores of intellectual wealth had long
      been tapped and explored, while news from without arrived but scantily.
      Indeed, amid the stillness the only sound to be heard would be that of old
      Oblomov&rsquo;s heavy, workaday slippers, the dull beat of the clock in its
      case, and the snapping of thread as one or another of the sewing party bit
      or broke off a piece. Perhaps after half an hour of this one of those
      present would yawn&mdash;then make the sign of the cross over the lips,
      and murmur: &ldquo;Lord, pardon me!&rdquo; Next, some one would follow suit, and then
      a third, until the infectious desire to ventilate the lungs had gone the
      round of the company. Next, old Oblomov would approach the window, look
      through it, and say with a touch of surprise: &ldquo;Only five o&rsquo;clock, yet
      already it is dark in the courtyard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; some one would answer, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis always dark by this time. The
      long evenings are beginning to draw in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spring, contrariwise, the company would fall to expressing surprise and
      gratification at the thought that the long <i>days</i> were approaching.
      Yet, had you inquired what the long days meant to them, they could not
      possibly have told you! After this episode silence would resume its sway,
      until, perhaps, in snuffing the candle, some one would chance to
      extinguish it. Upon that every one would give a start, and one of the
      company would be sure to ejaculate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unexpected guest is making his way in our direction.&rdquo; In fact, it was
      not an uncommon phenomenon for the incident to give rise to a lengthy
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, at Oblomovka, was reckoned mostly by festivals, by the seasons of
      the year, and by various family and domestic events&mdash;no reference
      whatsoever being made, to months or to the days of a month. This may have
      partly arisen from the fact that none but old Oblomov were capable of
      distinguishing between the names of the months and the dates in a given
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the head of the family would relapse into meditation, while
      little Ilya, lolling behind his mother&rsquo;s back, would also be sunk in
      dreams, and at times actually dozing. Suddenly old Oblomov would (to take
      a typical incident) halt in the middle of his pacing, and clap his hand
      anxiously to the tip of his nose; whereupon there would ensue some such
      dialogue as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The master of the house:</i> What on earth is the matter with me? See!
      Some one must have passed away, for the tip of my nose is itching!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>His wife:</i> Good Lord! Why should any one have passed away because
      the <i>tip</i> of your nose is sore? Some one has passed away only when
      the <i>bridge</i> of one&rsquo;s nose is hurting one. What a forgetful man you
      are, to be sure! Were you to say a thing like that before strangers, you
      would make us blush for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The master of the house:</i> But <i>every</i> part of my nose is
      hurting me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>His wife:</i> Pain at the side of it means news to come; in the
      eyebrows, sorrow; in the forehead, a greeting; on the right side, a man;
      on the left side, a woman; in the ears, rain; in the lips, a kiss; in the
      whiskers, a present of something to eat; in the elbow, a new place to
      sleep in; and in the sole of the foot, a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so forth, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, when nine o&rsquo;clock had struck there would follow supper; after
      which the company would disperse to rest, and sleep would once more reign
      over the care-free heads of the Oblomovkans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his dream Oblomov saw not only an evening spent in this manner, but
      whole weeks and months and years of such evening&rsquo;s. Never did anything
      occur to interrupt the uniformity of that life, nor were the Oblomovkans
      in any way wearied by it, since they could conceive no other existence,
      and would have turned from any other with distaste. Had there been
      imported into that existence any change due to circumstances, they would
      have regretted the fact, and felt troubled by the thought that to-morrow
      was not going to be precisely as to-day. What wanted <i>they</i> with the
      diversity, the changes, the incidents, for which others yearned? &ldquo;Let
      others drink of that cup,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;but for us Oblomovkans&mdash;no
      such thing. Let others live as they please.&rdquo; Incident&mdash;even pleasing
      incident&mdash;they considered to bring disturbance and fuss and worry and
      commotion in its train, so that one could not sit quietly in one&rsquo;s seat
      and just talk and eat one&rsquo;s meals. Therefore, as decade succeeded decade,
      the Oblomovkans dozed and yawned, and indulged in good-humoured laughter
      at rustic jests, and assembled in corners to relate of what they had
      dreamed during the previous night. Had their dreams been unpleasant, the
      company at once became thoughtful and nervous, and refrained from jesting.
      On the other hand, had their dreams been of a prophetic nature, at once
      the company grew cheerful or despondent, according as the visions had
      promised sorrow or joy. Lastly, had their dreams called for the
      consideration of some portent, the company proceeded to take such active
      measures as might be necessary to deal with the situation. Also, every one
      indulged in card-playing, games of &ldquo;fools,&rdquo; and so forth; while, as for
      the womenfolk, they would discuss the neighbourhood, and pry not only into
      its family life and social gaiety, but also into its secret ends and
      desires. About these they would dispute, and then pass censure upon
      various persons (more particularly upon unfaithful husbands), and relate
      details of birthdays, christenings, namedays, and dinner parties, with the
      lists of the invited and non-invited guests. Likewise they would show one
      another various articles of their wardrobes, and the hostess would proudly
      vaunt the merits of her sheets, her knitted garments, and her lace of home
      manufacture. Yet at length even these things would begin to pall;
      whereupon coffee, tea, and cakes would be served, and a silence, broken
      only by desultory remarks, ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, also, there were certain rare occasions when these methods of
      spending the time were interrupted by such happenings as the entire
      household falling ill of a fever, or some member of it either tripping
      over a stake in the dark or falling out of the hayloft or being struck on
      the head by a beam which had slipped from the roof. Yet, as I say, such
      events were rare, and when they occurred, every known and tried domestic
      remedy was brought into play. The injured spot was rubbed with ointment, a
      dose of holy water was administered, a prayer was muttered&mdash;and all
      was well. On the other hand, a winter headache * was quite a common
      phenomenon and in that case the household would retire to bed, groans and
      sighs would resound. One person would wrap a cucumber poultice and insert
      cranberries in his ears. A third walk about with nothing on but his shirt
      conscious, roll about the room at regular periods of once or twice a
      month. This happened, for the reason that the Oblomovkans did not like to
      allow any superfluous heat to escape by the chimney, but covered the
      stoves when the flames were rising high. Consequently upon no single
      stove-couch or stove could a hand be laid without danger of that hand
      being blistered.

</pre>
    <p>
      Only once was the monotony of Oblomovkan life broken by a wholly
      unexpected circumstance. The household, exhausted by the labours of
      dinner, had assembled for tea, when there entered a local peasant who had
      just been making an expedition to the town. Thrusting his hand into his
      bosom, he with difficulty produced a much-creased letter, addressed to the
      master of the house. Every one sat thunderstruck, and even the master
      himself changed countenance. Not an eye was there which did not dart
      glances at the missive. Not a nose was there which was not strained in its
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unlooked for!&rdquo; at length said the mistress of the household as she
      recovered herself. &ldquo;From whom can the letter have come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Oblomov took it, and turned it over in his hands, as though at a loss
      what to do with the epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get it from?&rdquo; he inquired of the peasant. &ldquo;And who gave it
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it at the inn where I put up,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;Twice did folk
      come from the post-office to inquire if any peasantry from Oblomovka were
      there, since a letter was awaiting the <i>barin</i>. The first time they
      came, I kept quiet, and the postman took the letter away; but afterwards
      the deacon of Verklevo saw me, and they came and gave me the letter, and
      made me pay five kopecks for it. I asked them what I was to do with the
      letter, and they said that I was to hand it to your Honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at first you refused it?&rsquo; the mistress remarked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I refused it. What should <i>we</i> want with letters? <i>We</i>
      have no need for them, nor had I any orders to take charge of such things.
      So I was afraid to touch it. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go too fast with that thing,&rsquo; I
      said to myself. Yet how the postman abused me! He would have complained to
      the authorities had I left the letter where it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from whom can it be?&rdquo; said old Oblomov meditatively as he studied the
      address. &ldquo;Somehow I seem to know the handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon that the missive fell to being passed from one person to another; and
      much guessing and discussion began. Finally the company had to own itself
      nonplussed. The master of the house ordered his spectacles to be fetched,
      and quite an hour and a half were consumed in searching for the same; but
      at length be put them on, and then bethought him of opening the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said his wife, hastily, arresting his hand. &ldquo;Do not break
      the seal. Who knows what the letter may contain? It may portend something
      dreadful, some misfortune. To what have we not come nowadays? To-morrow,
      or the day after, will be soon enough. The letter will not walk away of
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the letter was placed under lock and key, and tea passed round. In
      fact, the document would have lain there for a year, had it not
      constituted a phenomenon so unusual as to continue to excite the
      Oblomovkans&rsquo; curiosity. Both after tea and on the following day the talk
      was of nothing else. At length things could no longer be borne, and on the
      fourth day, the company being assembled, the seal was diffidently broken,
      and old Oblomov glanced at the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Radistchev!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;So the message is from Philip Matveitch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Ah! From <i>him</i>, indeed?&rdquo; resounded on all sides. &ldquo;To think that
      he is actually alive! Glory be to God! And what does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon that old Oblomov started to read the letter aloud. It seemed that
      Philip Matveitch desired him to forward the recipe for a certain beer
      which was brewed at Oblomovka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send it, send it,&rdquo; exclaimed the chorus. &ldquo;Yes, and also write him an
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really we <i>must</i> write that note,&rdquo; old Oblomov kept repeating.
      &ldquo;Where is the recipe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; retorted his wife. &ldquo;Why, it still has to be looked for.
      Wait a little. Why need we hurry? Should God be good, we shall soon be
      having another festival, and eating flesh again. Let us write <i>then</i>.
      I tell you, the recipe won&rsquo;t run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I daresay it would be better to write when we have reached the
      festival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the said festival arrived, and again there was talk of the
      letter. In fact, old Oblomov did in truth get himself ready to write it.
      He shut himself up in his study, he put on his spectacles, and he sat down
      to the table. Everything in the house was profoundly quiet, since orders
      had been issued that the establishment was not to stamp upon the floor,
      nor, indeed, to make a noise of any kind. &ldquo;The <i>barin</i> is writing,&rdquo;
       was said in much the same tone of respectful awe that might have been used
      had a dead person been lying in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had old Oblomov inscribed the words &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo;&mdash;slowly and
      crookedly, and with a shaking hand, and as cautiously, as though he had
      been engaged in a dangerous task&mdash;when there entered to him his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have searched and searched,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but can find no recipe.
      Nevertheless the bedroom wardrobe still remains to be ransacked, so <i>how</i>
      can you write the letter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to go by the next post,&rdquo; her husband remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will it cost to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Oblomov produced an ancient calendar. &ldquo;Forty kopecks,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You are going to throw away <i>forty kopecks</i> on such a trifle?&rdquo;
       she exclaimed. &ldquo;We had far better wait until we are sending other things
      also to the town. Let the peasants know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>might</i> be better,&rdquo; agreed old Oblomov, tapping his pen against
      the table. With that he replaced the pen in the inkstand, and took off his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it <i>might</i> be better,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to this day no one knows how long Philip Matveitch had to wait for
      that recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there were times when old Oblomov actually took a book in his hands.
      What book it might be he did not care, for he felt no actual craving to
      read; he looked upon literature as a mere luxury which could easily be
      indulged in, or be done without, even as one might have a picture on one&rsquo;s
      wall, or one might not&mdash;one might go out for an occasional walk, or
      one might not. Hence, as I say, he was indifferent to the identity of a
      book, since he looked upon such articles as mere instruments of
      distraction from <i>ennui</i> and lack of employment. Also, he always
      adopted towards authors that half-contemptuous attitude which used to be
      maintained by gentry of the <i>ancien régime</i>; for, like many of his
      day, he considered a writer of books to be a roisterer, a ne&rsquo;er-do-well, a
      drunkard, a sort of merry-andrew. Also, he would read aloud items of
      intelligence from journals three years old&mdash;such items as, &ldquo;It is
      reported from The Hague that, on returning to the Palace from a short
      drive, the King gazed at the assembled onlookers through his spectacles,&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;At Vienna such and such an Ambassador has just presented his Letter of
      Credentials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, there was a day when he read aloud the intelligence that a certain
      work by a foreign writer had just been translated into Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only reason why they go in for translating such things,&rdquo; remarked a
      small landowner who happened to be present, &ldquo;is that they may wheedle more
      money out of us <i>dvoriané</i>.&rdquo; *
    </p>

     *  Squires, or gentry

    <p>
      Meanwhile the little Ilya was engaged in journeying backwards and forwards
      to Schtoltz&rsquo;s school every Monday, when he awoke, he felt overcome with
      depression, should he happen to hear Vassika&rsquo;s rapping voice shout aloud
      from the veranda: &ldquo;Antipka, harness the piebald, as the young <i>barin</i>
      has to drive over to the German&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Yes, then Ilya&rsquo;s heart would tremble,
      and he would repair sadly to his mother, who would know why he did so, and
      begin to gild the pill, while secretly sighing to herself at the thought
      that she was to be parted from the lad for a whole week. Indeed, on such
      mornings he could scarcely be given enough to eat, and scarcely could a
      sufficiency of buns and cakes and pies and sweetmeats be made to take with
      him (the said sufficiency being based upon an assumption that at the
      German&rsquo;s the pupils fared far from richly).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One couldn&rsquo;t overeat oneself there,&rdquo; said the Oblomovkans. &ldquo;For dinner
      one gets nothing but soup, roast, and cabbage, for tea only cold meat, and
      for supper <i>morgen fri</i>.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  German black pudding.
</pre>
    <p>
      However, there were Mondays when he did <i>not</i> hear Vassika&rsquo;s voice
      ordering the piebald to be harnessed, and when his mother met him with a
      smile and the pleasant tidings, that he was not to go to school that day,
      since the following Thursday would be a holiday, and it was not worth
      while for him to make the journey to and fro for a stay only of three
      days. At other times he would be informed that that week was the Week of
      Kindred, * and that therefore cake-baking, and not book-learning, would be
      the order of the day. Or on a Monday morning his mother would glance at
      him, and say: &ldquo;Your eyes look dull to-day. Are you <i>sure</i> that you
      are well?&rdquo; Then she would shake her head dubiously, and though the crafty
      youngster would be in perfect health, he would hold his tongue on the
      subject. Thereafter she would continue: &ldquo;You must stay at home this week,
      for God knows what might happen to you at that other place.&rdquo; And in her
      decision she would be confirmed by the whole of the rest of the household.
      True, these fond parents were not blind to the value of education; it was
      that they realized only its <i>external</i> value. That is to say, they
      could not look beyond the fact that education enabled folk to get on in
      the world so far as the acquisition of rank, crosses, and money was
      concerned. Certain evil rumours had arisen regarding the necessity, of
      learning not only one&rsquo;s letters, but also various branches of science
      which until now had remained unknown to the world of Oblomovka; but, as I
      say, the good folk of that place had only the dimmest, the remotest,
      comprehension of any <i>internal</i> demand for education, and therefore
      desired to secure for their little Ilya only certain showy advantages, and
      no more&mdash;to wit, a fine uniform, and the getting of him into the
      Civil Service (his mother even foresaw him become a provincial governor!).
      Yet this, they thought, ought to be attained at as little cost as
      possible, and by means of a covert evasion of the various rocks and
      barriers which lay strewn about the path of enlightenment. Yes, those
      rocks and barriers, they said, must be walked around, not scaled; learning
      must be assimilated lightly, and not at the cost of exhaustion both of
      body and mind. In their view the process need be continued only until the
      little Ilya had obtained some sort of a certificate to the effect that he
      had been through &ldquo;a course of the arts and sciences.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      But to this Oblomovkan system old Schtoltz was wholly opposed; and
      probably his German persistency would have carried the day, had he not had
      to contend with difficulties even in his own camp. That is to say, his son
      was accustomed to spoil young Oblomov by doing his exercises for him, and
      prompting him in his translations. Also, young Oblomov could clearly
      discern the differences between his home life and life at school. At home,
      no sooner would he have awakened than he would find Zakhar standing by his
      bed. Even as the nurse had done, Zakhar would draw on for the lad his
      stockings, and put on his boots; and if Master Ilya&mdash;now become a boy
      of fourteen&mdash;did not altogether approve of Zakhar&rsquo;s performances he
      would nudge the valet on the nose with his toe. Moreover, should the boy
      at any time want anything, he had three or four servants to hasten to do
      his bidding; and in this fashion he never learnt what it was to do a
      single thing for himself. Yet in the end his parents&rsquo; fond solicitude
      wearied him for at no time could he even cross the courtyard, or descend
      the staircase, without hearing himself followed by shouts of &ldquo;Where are
      you going to, Ilya?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How can you do that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You will fall and hurt
      yourself!&rdquo; Thus, pampered like an exotic plant in a greenhouse, he grew up
      slowly and drowsily, and in a way which turned his energies inwards, and
      gradually caused them to wither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet on rare occasions he would still awake as fresh and vigorous and
      cheerful as ever; he would awake feeling that an imp of mischief was
      egging him on to climb the roof, or to go and roll in a field, or to rush
      round the meadow where the hay was being cut, or to perch himself on the
      top of a fence, or to start teasing the farm dogs&mdash;in short, to take
      to running hither and thither and everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the thing was no longer to be borne; no longer could he resist
      the imp&rsquo;s prompting. One winter&rsquo;s morning, capless, he leaped from the
      veranda into the courtyard, and thence through the entrance gates.
      Thereafter, rolling a snowball hastily in his hands, he darted towards a
      crowd of boys. The fresh air cut his face, the frost nipped his ears, his
      mouth and throat felt choked with cold, but in his breast there was a
      great joy. He rushed forward as fast as his legs could carry him, he
      shouted and he laughed. In two seconds he was in the thick of the boys.
      One snowball he threw&mdash;it achieved a miss; a second snowball he threw&mdash;it
      achieved the same; and just as he was seizing a third his face became
      converted into one large clot of snow. He fell, and, being unused to
      falling, hurt himself; yet still he laughed merrily, though the tears had
      sprung to his eyes. Behind the knot of youngsters ran two dogs, pulling at
      their clothes; for, as every one knows, dogs cannot with equanimity see a
      human being running. Thus the whole gang sped through the village&mdash;a
      noisy, shouting, barking crew. At length the lads were caught, and justice
      was meted out&mdash;to one on the head, to a second on the ears, to a
      third on the rump. Also, the fathers of the culprits were threatened with
      retribution. As for the young <i>barin</i>, he was hastily thrust into a
      snatched-up greatcoat, then into his father&rsquo;s sheepskin, and, lastly, into
      a couple of quilts; after which he was borne homeward in triumph. The
      entire household had expected to behold him arrive in a moribund
      condition; and indescribable was his parents&rsquo; delight on seeing him
      carried in both alive and unharmed..Yes, they gave thanks to God, they
      dosed the boy with mint and elderberry wine and raspberry syrup, and they
      kept him three days in bed&mdash;although the one thing that would have
      done him any good would have been to have let him go out again and play in
      the snow!

      Entering quietly, Zakhar tried to arouse the sleeper, but failed. Suddenly
      a loud laugh proceeded from the neighbourhood of the door. Oblomov started
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schtoltz! Schtoltz!&rdquo; he cried rapturously as he threw himself upon the
      newcomer.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ften Oblomov&rsquo;s old
      school friend had endeavoured&mdash;though in vain&mdash;to wean his
      comrade from the state of inertia in which he (Oblomov) was plunged. The
      pair were discussing the same subject in Oblomov&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; said Schtoltz, &ldquo;I remember you a slim, lively young
      fellow. Have you forgotten our joint readings of Rousseau, Schiller,
      Goethe, and Byron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I forgotten them?&rdquo; re-echoed Oblomov. &ldquo;No. How could I forget them?
      How I used to dream over those books, and to whisper to myself my hopes
      for the future, and to make plans of all sorts!&mdash;though I kept them
      from you for fear lest you would laugh at them. But that expired at
      Verklevo; and never since has it been repeated. What is the reason, I
      would ask? Never have I gone through any great mental tempest or upheaval,
      my conscience is as clear as a mirror, and no adverse stroke of fortune
      has occurred to destroy my self-conceit. Yet for some reason or another I
      have gone to pieces.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;You see, Andrei, at no point in my life
      have I been touched with a fire which could either save me or destroy me.
      I have lived a life different from that of others. With me it has not been
      a morning dawn which, gradually broadening to a sultry, bustling noon, has
      faded, imperceptibly, naturally, into eventide. No, I <i>began</i> life
      with a quenching of the light of day, and, from the first moment that I
      realized myself, realized also that I was on the wane. I realized that
      fact as I sat at my desk in the chancellory, as I read, as I consorted
      with friends, as I squandered my means upon Minia, as I lounged on the
      Nevski Prospect, as I attended receptions where I was welcomed as an
      eligible <i>parti</i>, as I wasted my life and brains in fluctuating
      between town and country. Even my self-conceit&mdash;upon what was it
      flung away? Upon figuring in clothes made by a good tailor, upon gaining
      the <i>entrée</i> to well-known houses, upon having my hand shaken by
      Prince P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! Yet self-conceit ought to be the very salt
      of life. Whither is mine gone? Either I have never understood the life of
      which I speak or it was never suited to me. Oh, that I had never known or
      seen it, that no one had ever pointed it out to me! For yourself, you
      entered and left my orbit like a bright, swift comet; and when you were
      gone I forgot everything, and began to fade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Schtoltz listened to Oblomov&rsquo;s words there was no trace of a
      contemptuous smile on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long ago,&rdquo; resumed Oblomov, &ldquo;you said that my face had lost its
      freshness and colour. Yes, that is so. I am like a ragged, cast-off
      garment&mdash;though less from the fact that during the past twelve years
      there has lain within me a light that has ever been seeking an outlet, but
      has been doomed to illumine only its own prison. Now, therefore, unable to
      gain its freedom, it is becoming altogether extinguished. Am I alone in
      this, however? Look around you. The name of the tribe to which I belong is
      legion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I intend to take you travelling with me,&rdquo; remarked
      Schtoltz, rising. &ldquo;We will start to-morrow. It must be done now or never.&rdquo;
       With that he went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now or never.&rdquo; Somehow to Oblomov the words seemed a sort of threat. He
      approached his dusty writing-table, and took up a pen. Of ink there was
      none, nor yet a single scrap of writing-paper. Mechanically and at random
      he traced some letters in the dust with his finger. There resulted the
      word <i>Oblomovstchina</i>. * He obliterated it with a quick movement of
      his sleeve. Often in his dreams had he seen the word written in letters of
      fire on the ceiling, even as once Belshazzar saw characters traced on the
      wall of his banqueting-room. &ldquo;Now or never.&rdquo; Oblomov listened to this last
      despairing call of his reason and his energy, and, weighing; in the
      balance what little volition still remained to him, considered to what end
      he could best devote that sorry fragment. Which was he to do? To go
      forward or to stand still? To go forward would mean divesting, not only
      his shoulders, but also his intellect, his soul, of his dressing-gown; it
      would mean sweeping away, not only from his chamber walls, but also from
      his eyes, the dust and the cobwebs. Yet how was he to take the first step
      necessary? Where was he to begin? He remembered Schtoltz&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Go to
      Oblomovka, and there learn what sowing and grinding mean, and why the
      peasant is poor or rich. Walk the fields, attend the local elections,
      visit the mills, and linger by the river wharves.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The disease of Oblomovka. See later.
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, that was what Schtoltz had said. But it would mean going forward, and
      going forward unceasingly. In that case farewell to they poetic ideal of
      life! Such a course would connote work in a smithery rather than life: it
      would entail a continual round of heat and of clatter. What would be the
      good of it? Would it not be better to stand still? To stand still would
      merely mean occasionally putting on a shirt inside out, dinners with
      Tarantiev, thinking as little as possible of anything, leaving &ldquo;A Voyage
      to Africa&rdquo; unread to the end, and attaining a peaceful old age in the fiat
      of which Tarantiev had spoken. &ldquo;Now or never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be or not to be.&rdquo; Oblomov rose from his chair, but, failing at once to
      insert his foot into a slipper, sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later Schtoltz departed for, England, after exacting from
      Oblomov a pledge to join him later in Paris. Oblomov even went to the
      length of procuring a passport, ordering an expensive travelling coat, and
      purchasing a cap. The furniture of the flat was to be removed to the
      quarters of Tarantiev&rsquo;s crony in the Veaborg Quarter, and stored in the
      three rooms until its owner&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month went by&mdash;three months; yet Oblomov still did not start.
      Schtoltz, who had reached Paris long ago, continued to send him letter
      after letter, but they remained unanswered. Why so? Was it because the ink
      in the inkstand had become dried up and no writing-paper was available?
      No; both ink, pens, and paper were present in abundance. Indeed, more than
      once Oblomov sat down to write, and did so fluently, and, at times, as
      expressively and eloquently as he had done in the days when, with
      Schtoltz, he had dreamed of the strenuous life, and of traveling. Likewise
      he had taken to rising at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and to reading,
      and to carrying books about with him. Also, his face had lost its look of
      dreaminess, weariness, <i>ennui</i>&mdash;there was colour in his cheek, a
      sparkle in his eye, and an air almost of adventurousness&mdash;at least,
      almost of self-assurance&mdash;about his whole bearing. Lastly, no longer
      was the dressing-gown to be seen, for Tarantiev had carried it off to his
      friend&rsquo;s flat, along with the rest of Oblomov&rsquo;s effects. Thus Oblomov wore
      better clothes than had been his wont, and even sang cheerfully as he
      moved about. Why so? The reason was that there had come into his life two
      friends of Schtoltz&rsquo;s, in the shape of a pretty girl named Olga Sergievna
      Ilyinitch and her aunt. On his first visit to them he was overcome with
      constraint. &ldquo;How gladly I would take off my gloves!&rdquo; he thought to
      himself. &ldquo;And how hot the room is! And how unused to this sort of thing I
      have grown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, she <i>will</i> keep looking at me,&rdquo; was his further reflection
      as diffidently he scanned his clothes. He even wiped his face with his
      handkerchief, lest a smut should have settled on his nose. Also, he
      touched his tie, to make sure that its folds had not come undone, as had
      sometimes happened with him. But no&mdash;all was as it should be. Yet she
      would persist in regarding him attentively. Next, a footman tendered him a
      cup of tea, with a plate of biscuits. He tried to subdue his nervousness,
      and to unbend; but in the act of unbending he seized such a handful of
      cracknels, biscuits, and sugared buns that the girl tittered and the rest
      of those present gazed at the pile with unconcealed interest. &ldquo;My God, she
      is still looking at me!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;What on earth am I to do
      with all these biscuits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without looking, he could tell that Olga had risen from her seat and moved
      to another corner. This helped to relieve his breast of a certain amount
      of weight. None the less she continued to contemplate him, in order to see
      what he would do with the confectionery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably I had best eat them as quickly as possible,&rdquo; he thought; with
      which he fell to hurriedly selecting one after another. Luckily all were
      of the sort which melts in the mouth. When only two of them remained he
      heaved a sigh of relief, and decided to glance towards the corner where he
      knew Olga to be seated. Horrors! She was standing by a bust, with one hand
      resting on its pedestal, and her eyes closely observing him! Nay, she had
      even come out of her corner to get a closer view of him! Without doubt she
      must have noted his awkwardness with the biscuits!
    </p>
    <p>
      True, at supper she sat at the other end or the table, and ate and talked
      as though she were in no way concerned with him; yet never once did he
      throw a timid glance in her direction (in the hope that she was not
      looking his way) but straightway he encountered her gaze&mdash;a gaze
      which, though good-humoured, was also charged with curiosity. That was
      enough. He hastened to take leave of her aunt, who invited him to come and
      dine another day. He bowed, and moved away across the drawing-room without
      raising his eyes. Presently he encountered a screen, with behind it, the
      grand piano. He looked again&mdash;and behold, behind the screen was
      seated Olga! She was still gazing at him with intent curiosity. Also, she
      seemed to him to be smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly Andrei has often told me that I put on pairs of odd socks, and
      my shirt inside out,&rdquo; he reflected as he drove home. From that moment he
      could not get Olga&rsquo;s glance out of his head. In bed he lay on his back and
      tried to adopt the most comfortable attitudes; yet still he could not
      sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine morning Tarantiev came and carried off the rest of Oblomov&rsquo;s
      furniture; with the result that its owner spent three such days as he had
      never before experienced&mdash;days during which he was bedless and
      sofa-less, and therefore driven to dine at the house of Olga&rsquo;s aunt.
      Suddenly he noticed that opposite the aunt&rsquo;s house there stood an
      untenanted villa. Consequently he hired it (furnished) at sight, and went
      to live there. Thereafter he spent his whole time with Olga&mdash;he read
      with her, he culled flowers with her, he walked by the lake and over the
      hills with her. Yes, he, Oblomov! How came this about? It came about thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the fateful dinner-party at the aunt&rsquo;s house Oblomov
      experienced the same torture during the meal as he had done on the
      previous occasion. Every word that he spoke he uttered with an acute sense
      that over him, like a searchlight, there was hovering that glance, and
      that it was burning and irritating him, and that it was stimulating his
      nerves and blood. Surely, on the balcony, he thought, he would be able,
      when ensconced behind a cloud of tobacco smoke, to succeed in momentarily
      concealing himself from that silent, that insistent gaze?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; he said to himself as he rocked himself to and
      fro. &ldquo;Why, it is sheer torture! Have I made myself ridiculous? At no one
      else would she dare to stare as she does at me. I suppose it is because I
      am quieter than the rest. However, I will make an agreement with her. I
      will tell her, in so many words, that her eyes are dragging my very soul
      out of my body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she appeared on the threshold of the balcony. He handed her a
      chair, and she took a seat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you so very <i>ennuyé?</i>&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ennuyé</i>, yes&mdash;but not much so. I have pursuits of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? Schtoltz tells me that you are engaged in drawing up a scheme of some
      sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I want to live upon my estate, and am making a few preparations for
      doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly&mdash;as soon as ever Schtoltz is ready to accompany me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be very glad to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. A smile wras hovering on her face, and illuminating her
      eyes, and gradually spreading over her cheeks. Only her lips remained as
      pressed together as usual. He lacked the spirit to continue his lies
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I&mdash;I am rather a lazy person,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;But, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he felt vexed to think that <i>she</i> should have extracted from
      him a confession of his lethargy. &ldquo;What is she to me?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Am I
      <i>afraid</i> of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lazy?&rdquo; she exclaimed with a scarcely perceptible touch of archness.
      &ldquo;What? A man be lazy? That passes my comprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it?&rdquo; was his inward comment. &ldquo;It is all simple enough. I have
      taken to sitting at home more and more, and therefore Schtoltz thinks that
      I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I expect you write a great deal?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And have you read
      much?&rdquo; Somehow her gaze seemed very intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot say that I have.&rdquo; The words burst from him in a sudden fear
      lest she should see fit: to put him through a course of literary
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she inquired, laughing. Then he too laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you were going to crossquestion me about some novel or
      another,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But, you see, I never read such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you thought wrong. I was only going to ask you about a few books of
      travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her quickly. Her lips were still compressed, but the rest of
      her face was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be very, careful with her,&rdquo; he refleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you read?&rdquo; she asked with seeming curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happens that I am particularly fond of books of travel,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travels in Africa, for instance?&rdquo; There was quiet demureness in the tone.
      He reddened at the not wholly unreasonable conjecture that she was aware
      not only of <i>what</i> he read but of <i>how</i> he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you also musical?&rdquo; she continued, in order to relieve him of his
      embarrassment. At this moment Schtoltz (who had now returned from abroad)
      appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Ilya!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have told Olga Sergievna that you adore music,
      and that to-night she must sing something&mdash;&lsquo;Casta Diva,&rsquo; for
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you speak for me at all?&rdquo; protested Oblomov. &ldquo;I am by no means an
      adorer of music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Schtoltz exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, the man is offended! I introduce him as
      a person of taste, and here is he stumbling over himself to destroy his
      good reputation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only declining the rôle of connoisseur,&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
      too difficult and risky a rôle. Sometimes I can listen with pleasure to a
      cracked barrel-organ, and its tunes stick in my memory; while at other
      times I leave the Opera before the piece is half over. It all depends upon
      the mood in which I am. In fact, there are moments when I could close my
      ears even to Mozart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is clear that you <i>do</i> love music,&rdquo; said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing him something,&rdquo; requested Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose that Monsieur Oblomov were, at this very moment, to be
      feeling inclined to close his ears?&rdquo; she said as she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to utter some compliment or another,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But
      I cannot do so, and I would not, even if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s naïve rejoinder, &ldquo;things would be so awkward for
      me if I were to find that you sing badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even as, the other day, you found things awkward with the biscuits?&rdquo; she
      retorted before she could stop herself. The next moment she reddened as
      though she would have given worlds to have been able to recall her words.
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I ought not to have said that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov had been unprepared, and was quite taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a cruel advantage,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;only a small revenge (and an unpremeditated one) for your
      failure to have had a compliment ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps I will have one ready when I have heard you sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You wish me to sing, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; <i>he</i> wishes it.&rdquo; Oblomov pointed to Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov shook his head deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not wish for what I have not yet experienced,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very rude, Ilya,&rdquo; put in Schtoltz. &ldquo;See what comes of lolling
      about at home and confining your efforts to having your socks put on for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Oblomov quickly, and without giving him time to finish.
      &ldquo;I should find it no trouble to say: &lsquo;I shall be most glad, most
      delighted, to hear you sing, for of course you sing perfectly.&rsquo; So,&rdquo; he
      went on, &ldquo;&lsquo;it will afford me the very greatest possible pleasure.&rsquo; But do
      you really think it necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you might express a desire that I should sing&mdash;if only out
      of curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not do so,&rdquo; replied Oblomov. &ldquo;You are not an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it shall be for <i>you</i> that I will sing,&rdquo; she said to Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you, Ilya,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;can be getting your compliment ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evening was closing in, and the lamp had been lit. Moonlike, it cast
      through the ivy-covered trellis a light so dim that the dusk still veiled
      the outlines of Olga&rsquo;s face and figure&mdash;it still shrouded them, as it
      were, in crepe; while the soft, strong voice, vibrating with nervous
      tension, came ringing through the darkness with a note of mystery. At
      Schtoltz&rsquo;s prompting she sang several arias and romances, of which some
      expressed suffering, with a vague forecast of joy, while others expressed
      joy, coupled with a lurking germ of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Oblomov listened he could scarcely restrain his tears or the cry of
      ecstasy that was almost bursting from his soul. In fact, he would have
      undertaken the tour abroad if thereby he could have remained where he was
      at that moment, and <i>then</i> gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I pleased you to-night?&rdquo; she inquired of Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask, rather, Oblomov,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Confess now, Ilya: how long is it
      since you felt as you are feeling at this moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet he might have felt like that this morning if &lsquo;a cracked barrel-organ&rsquo;
      had happened to pass his window,&rdquo; put in Olga&mdash;but so kindly as to
      rob the words of their sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never keeps his windows open,&rdquo; remarked Schtoltz. &ldquo;Consequently, he
      could not possibly hear what is going on outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Oblomov was powerless to sleep. He paced the room in a mood of
      thoughtful despondency, and at dawn left the house to roam the city, with
      his head and his heart full of God only knows what feelings and
      reflections!
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he called again at the aunt&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Olga, &ldquo;to feel thoroughly at home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then pray do not look at me as you are doing now, and as you have always
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly her glance lost its usual expression or curiosity, and became
      wholly softened to kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you mind my looking at you so much?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. Somehow your gaze seems to draw from me everything that I
      would rather people did not learn&mdash;you least of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? You are a friend of Schtoltz&rsquo;s, and he is a friend of mine, and
      therefore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore there is no reason why you should know as much about me as
      he does,&rdquo; concluded Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there <i>is</i> no reason. But at least there is a <i>possibility</i>
      that I may do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&mdash; thanks to his talkativeness! Indeed a poor service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, any secrets to conceal&mdash;or even crimes?&rdquo; With a
      little laugh she edged away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to put on odd socks <i>is</i> a grave crime,&rdquo; she remarked with
      demure timidity. Oblomov seized his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will <i>not</i> stand this!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yet you want me to feel at home
      here! As for Schtoltz, I detest him! <i>He</i> told you about the socks, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pardon me this once, and I will try to look at you
      in quite a different way. As a matter of fact, &rsquo;tis <i>you</i> who
      are looking at <i>me</i> in rather an odd fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      True enough, he was gazing into her kindly, grey-blue eyes&mdash;he was
      doing so simply because he could not help it&mdash;and thinking to himself
      that never in all the world had he seen a maiden so beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something seems to pass from her into myself,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;And that
      something is making my heart beat and boil. My God, what a joy to the eye
      she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The important question,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is how to preserve you from
      feeling <i>ennuyé</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do that by singing to me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I was expecting that compliment!&rdquo; The words came from her in a sudden
      burst as of pleasure. &ldquo;Do you know, had you not uttered that gasp after I
      had finished singing the other evening, I should never have slept all
      night&mdash;I should have cried my very eyes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. I merely know that that time I sang as I had never done
      before. Do not ask me to sing now, however&mdash;I could not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she did sing to him again; and, ah! what did that song not
      voice? It seemed to be charged with her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she finished, his face was shining with the happiness of a spirit which
      has been moved to its utmost depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why do you look at me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet she knew why he was doing so, and a modest touch of triumph that she
      could so greatly have affected him filled her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at yourself in the mirror,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and you will see that your
      eyes are shining, and that&mdash;yes, really!&mdash;they have tears in
      them. How deeply you must feel music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it is not music that I am feeling,&rdquo; he replied slowly; &ldquo;but&mdash;but
      <i>love!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her glance met his, and instantly she saw that he had uttered the word in
      spite of himself, that the word had got him in its power, and that the
      word had voiced the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering himself, he picked up his hat, and left the room. When he had
      gone she remained standing like a statue by the piano&mdash;her eyes cast
      down, and her breast rising and falling tumultuously.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rom that time
      forth she lived in him alone, while he, for his part, racked his brains to
      avoid incurring the loss of her esteem. Whenever she detected in his soul&mdash;and
      she could probe that soul very deeply&mdash;the least trace of its former
      characteristics, she would work for him to heap himself with reproaches
      for his lethargy and fear of life. Just as he was about to yawn, as he was
      actually opening his mouth for the purpose, her astonished glance would
      transfix him, and cause his mouth to snap with a click which jarred his
      teeth. Still more did he hasten to resume his alacrity whenever he
      perceived that his lassitude was communicating itself to her, and
      threatening to render her cold and contemptuous. Instantly he would
      undergo a revival of strenuous activity; and then the shadow between them
      would disappear, and mutual sympathy once more beat in strong, clear
      accord. Yet this solicitude on his part had not, as yet, its origin in the
      magic ring of love. Indeed, the effect of his charmed toils was negative
      rather than positive. True, he no longer slept all day&mdash;on the
      contrary, he rode, read, walked, and even thought of resuming his writing
      and his agricultural schemes; yet the ultimate direction, the inmost
      significance, of his life still remained confined to the sphere of good
      intentions. Particularly disturbing did he find it whenever Olga plied him
      with some particular question or another, and demanded of him, as of a
      professor, full satisfaction of her curiosity. This occurred frequently,
      and arose not out of pedantry on her part, but out of a desire to know the
      right and the wrong of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times a given question would absorb her even to the point of forgetting
      her consideration for Oblomov. For instance, on one occasion, when she had
      besought his opinion concerning double stars, and he was incautious enough
      to refer her to Herschel, he was dispatched to purchase the great
      authority&rsquo;s book, and commanded to read it through, and to explain the
      same to her full satisfaction. On another occasion he was rash enough to
      let slip a word or two concerning various schools of painting; wherefore
      he had to undergo another week&rsquo;s reading and explaining, and also to pay
      sundry visits to the Hermitage Museum. In the end how he trembled whenever
      she asked him a question!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not say something?&rdquo; she would say to him. &ldquo;Surely it cannot be
      that the subject wearies you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but how I love you!&rdquo; he would reply, as though awakening from a
      trance; to which she would retort&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really? But that is not what I have just asked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion he said to her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you see what is taking place in me? To me, speaking is a
      difficulty. Give me your hand, give me your hand! There seems to be
      something hindering me, something weighing me down. It is a something that
      is like the great rock which oppresses a man during deep sorrow. And,
      strangely enough, the effect of it is the same whether I happen to be sad
      or gay. Somehow my breath seems to hurt me as I draw it, and occasionally
      I come near to weeping. Yet, like a man overcome with grief, I feel that I
      should be lightened and relieved if I could weep. What, think you, is
      amiss with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a smile of happiness which nothing could disturb.
      Evidently no weight was pressing upon <i>her</i> heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I do not like the term for myself. I like you:
      that is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I like you&rsquo;?&rdquo; he re-echoed. &ldquo;But a mother or a father or a nurse or even
      a dog may be <i>liked</i>: the phrase may be used as a garment, even as
      can, can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even as can an old dressing-gown,&rdquo; she suggested with a smile. Presently
      she added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I am actually in love with you or not I hardly know. Perhaps it
      is a stage that has not yet arrived. All I know is that I have never liked
      father or mother or nurse or dog as I like you. I feel lost without you.
      To be parted from you for a short while makes me sorry; to be parted from
      you for a long while makes me sad; and, were you to die, I should wear
      mourning for the rest of my life, and never again be able to smile. To me
      such love is life, and life is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a duty, an obligation. Consequently love also is a duty. God has sent
      me that duty, and has bid me perform it.&rdquo; As she spoke she raised her eyes
      to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can have inspired her with these ideas?&rdquo; Oblomov thought to himself.
      &ldquo;Neither through experience nor through trial nor through &lsquo;fire and smoke&rsquo;
      can she have attained this clear, simple conception of life and of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, since there is joy in life, is there also suffering?&rdquo; he asked
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That lies beyond my experience as much as
      it lies beyond my understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how well <i>I</i> understand it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said merrily. &ldquo;What glances you throw at me sometimes! Even my
      aunt has noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can there be joy in love if it never brings one moments of
      ecstatic delight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she replied with a glance at the scene around her. &ldquo;Is not all <i>this</i>
      so much ecstatic delight?&rdquo; She looked at him, smiled, and gave him her
      hand. &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that presently I shall not be sorry
      when you take your leave? Do you think that I shall not go to bed the
      earlier in order that I may the sooner fall asleep, and cheat the
      wearisome night, and be able to see you again in the morning?&rdquo; The light
      in Oblomov&rsquo;s face had become brighter and brighter with each successive
      question, and his gaze more and more suffused with radiance.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext morning,
      however, he rose pale and sombre. There were traces of sleeplessness on
      his features, wrinkles on his brow, and a lack of fire and eagerness in
      his eyes. Once upon a time he would have sunk back upon the pillow after
      drinking his tea, but now he had grown out of the habit, and contented
      himself with resting his elbow where his head had just been lying.
      Something in him was working strongly; but that something was not love.
      True, Olga&rsquo;s image was still before him, but only at a distance, and in a
      mist, and shorn of its rays, like that of some stranger. With aching eyes
      he gazed at it for a moment or two, and then sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To live as God wills, and not as oneself wills, is a wise rule,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly that is so,&rdquo; presently he went on. &ldquo;Otherwise, one would fall
      into a chaos of contradictions such as no human mind, however daring and
      profound, could hope to resolve. Yesterday one has wished, to-day one
      attains the madly longed-for object, and tomorrow one will blush to think
      that one ever desired it. Therefore one will fall to cursing life. And all
      because of a proud, independent striding through existence and a wilful &lsquo;I
      will&rsquo;! No; rather does one need to feel one&rsquo;s way, to close one&rsquo;s eyes, to
      avoid becoming either intoxicated with happiness or inclined to repine
      because it has escaped one. Yes, <i>that</i> is life. Who was it first
      pictured life as happiness and gratification? The fool! &lsquo;Life is a duty,&rsquo;
      says Olga. &lsquo;Life is a grave obligation which must be fulfilled as such.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       He heaved a profound sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot visit Olga to-day,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;My eyes are now open, and I
      see my duty before me. Better part with her <i>now</i>, while it is still
      possible, than later, when I shall have sworn to part with her no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How had this mood of his come about? What wind had suddenly affected him?
      How had it brought with it these clouds? Wherefore was he now for assuming
      such a grievous yoke? Only last night he had looked into Olga&rsquo;s soul, and
      seen there a radiant world and a smiling destiny; only last night he had
      read both her horoscope and his own. What had since happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, in summer, one goes to sleep while the weather is still and
      cloudless, and the stars are glimmering softly. &ldquo;How beautiful the
      countryside will look to-morrow under the bright beams of morning!&rdquo; one
      thinks to oneself. &ldquo;And how glad one will be to dive into the depths of
      the forest and seek refuge from the heat!&rdquo; Then suddenly one awakes to the
      beating of rain, to the sight of grey, mournful clouds, to a sense of cold
      and damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Oblomov&rsquo;s breast the poison was working swiftly and vigorously. In
      thought he reviewed his life, and for the hundredth time felt his heart
      ache with repentance and regret for what he had lost. He kept picturing to
      himself what, by now, he would have been had he strode boldly ahead, and
      lived a fuller and a broader life, and exerted his faculties; whence he
      passed to the question of his present condition, and of the means whereby
      Olga had contrived to become fond of him, and of the reason why she still
      was so. &ldquo;Is she not making a mistake?&rdquo; was a thought which suddenly
      flashed through his mind like lightning; and as it did so the lightning
      seemed to strike his heart, and to shatter it. He groaned with the pain.
      &ldquo;Yes, she <i>is</i> making a mistake,&rdquo; he kept saying again and again.
      &ldquo;She merely loves me as she works embroidery on canvas. In a quiet,
      leisurely manner a pattern has evolved itself, and she has turned it over,
      and admired it. Soon she will lay it aside, and forget all about it. Yes,
      her present affection is a mere <i>making ready</i> to fall in love, a
      mere experiment of which I am the subject, for the reason that I chanced
      to be the first subject to come to hand.&rdquo; So he collated the
      circumstances, and compared them. Never would she have noticed him at all,
      had not Schtoltz pointed him out, and infected her young. impressionable
      heart with sympathy for his (Oblomov&rsquo;s) position, and therefore implanted
      in her a desire to see if possibly she could shake that dreamy soul from
      its lethargy before leaving it once more to its own devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is how the case stands,&rdquo; he said to himself with an access of
      revulsion. He rose and lit a candle with a trembling hand. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
      just that and nothing more. Her heart was ready to accept love&mdash;it
      was tensely awaiting it&mdash;and I happened to fall in her way, and at
      the same time to fall into a blunder. Only would some one else need to
      arrive for her to renounce that blunder. As soon as ever she saw that some
      one else she would turn from me with horror. In fact, I am stealing what
      belongs to another; I am no better than a thief. My God, to think that I
      should have been so blind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing into the mirror, he saw himself pale, dull, and sallow.
      Involuntarily he pictured to his mind those handsome young fellows who
      would one day come her way. Suddenly she would take fire, glance at him,
      and&mdash;burst out laughing! A second time he glanced into the mirror.
      No, he was <i>not</i> the type with which women could fall in love! He
      flung himself down upon the bed, and buried his face in the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Olga!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And may you always be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave orders that he was to be reported as &ldquo;not at home&rdquo; to any one who
      might call from the Ilyinskis&rsquo; house. Then he sat down to write Olga a
      letter. He wrote it swiftly. In fact, the pen flew over the pages. And
      when he had finished the missive he was surprised to find that his spirits
      felt cheered, and his mind easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Probably because I have put into what I have just
      written the whole sorrow of my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, he dispatched the letter by the hand of Zakhar, and, leaving the
      house, turned into the park, and seated himself on the grass. Among the
      turf-shoots ants were scurrying hither and thither, and jostling one
      another, and parting again. From above, the scene looked like the
      commotion in a human market-place&mdash;it showed the same bustle, the
      same congestion, the same swarm of population. Here and there, too, a
      bumble bee buzzed over a flower, and then crept into its chalice, while a
      knot of flies had glued themselves to a drop of sap on the trunk of a
      lime-tree, in the foliage a bird was repeating an ever-insistent note (as
      though calling to its mate), and a couple of butterflies were tumbling
      through the air in a giddy, fluttering, intricate movement which resembled
      a waltz. Everywhere from the herbage strong scents could be detected
      arising; everywhere there could be beard a ceaseless chirping and
      twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he saw Olga approaching. Walking very quietly, she was wiping her
      eyes with a handkerchief as she did so. He had not expected those tears.
      Somehow they seemed to sear his heart. He rose and ran to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga, Olga!&rdquo; were his first tender words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, looked at him with an air of astonishment, and turned away.
      He followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weeping?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and&rsquo; is <i>you</i> have made me do so,&rdquo; she replied, while her form
      shook with sobs. &ldquo;But it is beyond your power to comfort me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That miserable letter!&rdquo; he ejaculated, suddenly becoming full of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer she opened a basket which she was carrying, took from it the
      letter, and handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The sight of it will only make me weep more
      bitterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stuffed it silently into his pocket, and, with head bent, seated
      himself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me credit for good intentions,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;In any case the letter
      was evidence only of my care for your happiness&mdash;of the fact that I
      was thinking of it in advance, and was ready to sacrifice myself on its
      account. Do you think that I wrote the message callously&mdash;that
      inwardly I was not shedding tears the whole time? Why should I have acted
      as I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;For the reason that you wished to
      surprise me here, and to see whether I was weeping, and how bitterly. Had
      you <i>really</i> meant the letter as you say, you would be making
      preparations to go abroad instead of meeting me as you are now doing. Last
      night you wanted my &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;; to-day you want to see my tears; and
      to-morrow, I daresay, you will be wishing that I were dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you wrong me like that? Believe me, I would give half my life to
      see smiles on your face instead of tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;now that you have seen a woman weeping on your account. But no;
      you have no heart. You say that you had no desire to make me weep. Had
      that been so, you would not have acted as you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what ought I to do?&rdquo; he asked tenderly. &ldquo;Will you let me beg your
      pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only children beg pardon, or persons who have jostled some one in a
      crowd. Moreover, even when granted, such pardon is worth nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if the letter should be true, and your affection for me all a
      mistake?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are <i>afraid</i>, then?&mdash;you are afraid of falling into a well?&mdash;you
      are afraid lest some day I should hurt you by ceasing to be fond of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I could sink into the ground!&rdquo; he reflected. The pain was
      increasing in proportion as he divined Olga&rsquo;s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;suppose you were to weary of love, even
      as you have wearied of books, of work, and of the world in general?
      Suppose that, fearing no rival, you were to go to sleep by my side (as you
      do on your sofa at home), and that my voice were to become powerless to
      wake you? Suppose that your present swelling of heart were to pass away,
      and your dressing-gown come to acquire more value in your eyes than
      myself? Often and often do such questions prevent my sleeping; yet I do
      not, on that account, trouble <i>you</i> with conjectures as to the
      future. Always I hope for better things, for, with me, happiness has cast
      out fear. Only for one thing have I long been sitting and waiting&mdash;namely,
      for happiness; until at length I had come to believe that I had found
      it.... Even if I <i>have</i> made a mistake, at least this&rdquo;&mdash;and she
      laid her hand upon her heart&mdash;&ldquo;does not convict me of guilt. God
      knows that I never desired such a fate! And I had been so happy!&rdquo; She
      broke off abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be happy again,&rdquo; urged Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Rather, go you whither you have always been wishing to go,&rdquo; she said
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wiser than I am,&rdquo; he murmured, twisting a sprig of acacia between
      his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am simpler and more daring than you. What are you afraid of? Do you
      <i>really</i> think that I should cease to love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you by my side I fear nothing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;With you by my side
      nothing terrible can fall to my lot.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>blomov&rsquo;s face
      beamed as he walked home. His blood was boiling, and a light was shining
      in his eyes. He entered his room&mdash;and at once, the radiance
      disappeared as his eyes, full of disgusted astonishment, became glued to
      one particular spot. That particular spot was the arm-chair, wherein was
      snugly ensconced Tarantiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it I <i>never</i> find you here?&rdquo; the visitor asked sternly. &ldquo;Why
      are you <i>always</i> gadding about? That old fool Zakhar has quite got
      out of hand. I asked him for a morsel of food and a glass of <i>vodka</i>,
      and he refused me both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been for a walk in the park,&rdquo; replied Oblomov coldly. For the
      moment he had forgotten the murky atmosphere wherein he had spent so much
      of his life. And now, in a twinkling, Tarantiev had brought him tumbling
      from the clouds! His immediate, thought was that the visitor might insist
      on remaining to dinner, and so prevent him from paying his visit to Olga
      and her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not come and take a look at that flat?&rdquo; went on Tarantiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there is no need,&rdquo; replied Oblomov, avoiding his interlocutor&rsquo;s
      eye. &ldquo;I have decided not to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to move?&rdquo; exclaimed Tarantiev threateningly. &ldquo;Not when I have hired
      the place for you, and you have signed the lease?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This led Oblomov to remember that, on the very day of his removal from
      town to the country villa, he had signed, without previously perusing it,
      a document which his present visitor had submitted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I shall not want the flat. I am going
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are <i>not</i>,&rdquo; retorted Tarantiev coolly. &ldquo;What is more,
      the sooner you hand over to me a half-year&rsquo;s rent, the better. Your new
      landlady does not care for such tricks to be played upon her. I have paid
      the money on your behalf, and I require to be repaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you contrive to get the money from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has nothing to do with you. As a matter of fact, I had an old debt
      repaid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better flat you could not find in all the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless I do not want it. It lies too far from&mdash;from&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From where? From the centre of the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov forbore to specify what he meant, but merely remarked that he
      should not be dining at home that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hand me over the rent, and the devil take you!&rdquo; exclaimed Tarantiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I possess no money at all. As it is, I shall have to borrow some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, repay me at least my cab fare,&rdquo; insisted the visitor. &ldquo;It was only
      three roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the cabman? Why has he charged you so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dismissed him long ago. I may add that the fare home is another three
      roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the coach you could travel for half a rouble.&rdquo; However, Oblomov
      tendered Tarantiev four roubles, which the man at once pocketed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, I have expended some seven roubles on your account,&rdquo; went on
      Tarantiev. &ldquo;Besides, you might as well advance me something towards the
      price of a dinner. Roadside inns are dear. As a rule they fleece one of
      five roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently Oblomov handed him another rouble, in the hope that the man would
      now depart; but Tarantiev was not to be so easily shaken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also you might order Zakhar to bring me a snack <i>now</i>,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you intended to dine at an inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to <i>dine</i>, but at the moment the time is two o&rsquo;clock, and no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov issued the necessary orders. On receiving them, Zakhar looked
      darkly at Tarantiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no food ready,&rdquo; he said&rsquo;. &ldquo;Also, where are my master&rsquo;s shirt and
      jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shirt and jacket? Why, I gave them back to you long ago. I stuffed them
      into your own hands, and you bundled them away into a corner. Yet you come
      asking me where they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, what about a floorbrush and two cups which you carried off?&rdquo;
       persisted Zakhar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Floorbrush? What floorbrush?&rdquo; retorted Tarantiev. &ldquo;Go and get me
      something to eat, you old fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not a single morsel in the house,&rdquo; said Zakhar; &ldquo;and also there
      is nobody to cook it.&rdquo; With which he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tarantiev locked about him, and, perceiving Oblomov to be possessed both
      of a hat and a cap, attempted unsuccessfully to borrow the former for the
      remainder of the summer, and then took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone Oblomov sat plunged in thought. He recognized that his
      bright, cloudless holiday of love was over, and that workaday love had now
      become the order of the day, and that already it was so completely
      entering into his life&rsquo;s ordinary tendencies that things were beginning to
      lose their rainbow colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;this morning may have seen the extinction of the
      last roseate ray of love&rsquo;s festival&mdash;so that henceforth my life is to
      be warmed rather than lighted. Yes, life will swallow up love, although
      secretly it will remain moved by its powerful springs, and its
      manifestations be of an invariably simple, everyday nature. Yes, the poem
      is fading, and stem prose is to follow&mdash;to follow with a drab series
      of incidents which shall comprise a marriage ceremony, a journey to
      Oblomovka, the building of a house, an application to the local council,
      the laying out of roads, an endless transaction of business with peasants,
      a number of improvements, harvests, and so forth, the frequent spectacle
      of the bailiff&rsquo;s anxious face, elections to the council of nobles, and
      sundry sittings on the local bench,&rdquo; Somewhere he could see Olga beaming
      upon him, and singing <i>Casta Diva</i>, and then giving him a hasty kiss
      before he went forth to work, or to the town, or to interview the bailiff.
      Guests would call (a no very comforting prospect!), and they would talk
      about the wine which each happened to be brewing in his vats, and about
      the number of <i>arshins</i> * of cloth which each happened to have
      rendered to the Treasury. What would this amount to? What was it he was
      promising for himself? Was it life? Whether life or not, it would have to
      be lived as though it, and it alone, constituted existence. At least it
      would be an existence that would find favour with Schtoltz!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ells.
</pre>
    <p>
      But the actual wedding ceremony&mdash;that, at all events, would represent
      the poetry of life, its nascent, its just opening flower? He pictured
      himself leading Olga to the altar. On her head there would&rsquo; be a wreath of
      orange-blossoms, and to her gown a long train, and the crowd would whisper
      in amazement. Shyly, and with gently heaving bosom and brow bent forward
      in gracious pride, she would give him her hand in complete unconsciousness
      that the eyes of all were fixed upon her. Then, a bright smile would show
      itself on her face, the tears would begin to well, and for a moment or two
      the furrow on her forehead would twitch with thought. Then, when they had
      arrived home and the guests had all departed, she, yes, she&mdash;clad
      still in her gorgeous raiment&mdash;would throw herself upon his breast as
      she had done that morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable any longer to keep his fancies to himself, he went with them to
      Olga. She listened to him with a smile; but when he jumped up with the
      intention of informing also her aunt she frowned with such decision that
      he halted in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word to any one!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The right moment is not yet come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought we to do first, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go to the registrar, and to sign the record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After marriage to go and live at Oblomovka, and to see what can be done
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not be able to do that, for the house is in ruins, and a new one
      must first be built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where are we to live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take a flat in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better go at once and see about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;Olga wishes for ever to be on the move.
      Apparently she cares nothing about dreaming over the poetical phases of
      life, or losing herself in reveries. She is like Schtoltz. It would seem
      as though the two had conspired to live life at top speed.&rdquo;

      II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ate that August
      rain set in, and, one day, Oblomov saw a vanload of the Ilyinskis&rsquo;
      furniture come past his windows. To remain in his country villa, now that
      the park was desolate and the shutters hung closed over the Ilyinskis&rsquo;
      windows, seemed to him impossible. At length he removed to the rooms which
      had been recommended him by Tarantiev, until such time as he should be
      able to find for himself a new flat. He took hasty meals at restaurants,
      and spent most of his evenings with Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the long autumn evenings in town were not like the long, bright days
      amid fields and woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he could not visit Olga three times a day, nor send her notes by
      Zakhar, seeing that she was five versts away. Thus the polled poem of the
      late summer seemed somehow to have halted, or to be moving more slowly, as
      though it contained less substance than of yore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they would keep silence for quite half an hour at a time, while
      she busied herself with her needlework, and he busied himself in a chaos
      of thoughts which ranged beyond the immediate present. Only at intervals
      would he gaze at her and tremble with passion; only at intervals would she
      throw him a fleeting glance, and smile as she caught the rays of tender
      humility, of silent happiness, which his eyes conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet on the sixth day, when Olga invited him to meet her at a certain shop,
      and to escort her homeward on foot, he found his position begin to grow a
      trille awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you knew how difficult things are!&rdquo; he said. She returned no
      answer, but sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Until we have arranged
      everything we cannot possibly tell my aunt. Nor must we see so much of one
      another. You had better come to dinner only on Sundays and Wednesdays.
      Also, we might meet at the theatre occasionally, if I first give you
      notice that we are going to be there. Also, as soon as a fine day should
      occur I mean to go for a walk in the Summer Gardens, * and you might come
      to meet me. The scene will remind us of our park in the country.&rdquo; She
      added this last with a quiver of emotion.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  A public park in Petrograd
</pre>
    <p>
      He kissed her hand in silence, and parted from her until Sunday. She
      followed him with her eyes&mdash;then sat down to immerse herself in a
      wave of sound at the piano. But something in her was weeping, and the
      notes seemed to be weeping in sympathy. She tried to sing, but no song
      would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, Oblomov was lolling on the sofa and playing with one of
      his slippers&mdash;now picking it up from the door with his toe, now
      dropping it again. To him entered Zakhar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Oblomov indifferently. Zakhar said nothing, but eyed him
      with a sidelong glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Oblomov again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you yet found for yourself another flat?&rdquo; Zakhar countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. Why should you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I suppose the wedding will be taking place soon after Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wedding? What wedding?&rdquo; Oblomov suddenly leaped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what wedding&mdash;your own,&rdquo; replied Zakhar with assurance, as
      though he were speaking of an event long since arranged for. &ldquo;You are
      going to be married, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I to be married? To whom?&rdquo; And Oblomov glared at the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Mademoiselle Ilyinski&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Almost before the man could
      finish his words Oblomov had darted forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who put <i>that</i> idea into your head?&rdquo; he cried in a carefully
      suppressed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord bless its all and protect us!&rdquo; Zakhar ejaculated, backing
      towards the door. &ldquo;Who told me about it? Why, the Ilyinskis&rsquo; servants,
      this very summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; hissed Oblomov as he shook a warning finger at the old man.
      &ldquo;Remember&mdash;henceforth let me hear not a word about it!&rdquo; He pointed to
      the door, and Zakhar left the room&mdash;filling the flat with his sighs
      as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Oblomov could not recover his composure, but remained gazing at
      the spot which Zakhar had just vacated. Then he clasped his hands behind
      his head, and reseated himself in the arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the servants&rsquo; hall and the kitchen are talking!&rdquo; was his insistent
      reflection. &ldquo;It has come to this, that Zakhar can actually dare to ask me
      when the wedding is to be! Yes, and that though even Olga&rsquo;s aunt has not
      an inkling of the truth! What would she think of it if she knew? The
      wedding, that most poetical moment in the life of a lover, that crown of
      all his happiness&mdash;why, lacqueys and grooms are talking of it even
      though nothing is yet decided upon! No answer has come from the estate, my
      registry certificate is a blank, and a new flat still remains to be
      found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he fell to analysing that poetical phase from which the colour
      had faded with Zakhar&rsquo;s mention of the same. Oblomov was beginning to see
      the other face of the medal. He tossed and turned from side to side, lay
      flat on his back, leaped up and took a stride or two, and ended by sinking
      back into a reclining position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How come folk to know about it?&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Olga has kept silence,
      and I too have breathed not a word. So much for stolen meetings at dawn
      and sunset, for passionate glances, for the wizardry of song! Ah, those
      poems of love! Never do they end save in disaster. One should go beneath
      the wedding canopy before one attempts to swim in an atmosphere of roses.
      To think that before any preparations have been made&mdash;before even an
      answer has come, from the estate, or I have obtained either money or a
      flat&mdash;I should have to go to her aunt, and to say: &lsquo;This is my
      betrothed!&rsquo; At all costs must I put a stop to these rumours. Marriage!
      What <i>is</i> marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he remembered his recent poetical idealization of the
      ceremony&mdash;the long train to the gown, the orange-blossoms, the
      whispers of the crowd. Somehow the colours had now changed; the crowd now
      comprised also the uncouth, the slovenly Zakhar and the whole staff of the
      Ilyinskis&rsquo; servants&rsquo; ball. Also, he could see a long line of carriages and
      a sea of strange, coldly inquisitive faces. The scene was replete with
      glimmering, deadly weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning Zakhar to his presence, he again asked him how he had dared to
      spread such rumours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For do you know what marriage means?&rdquo; he demanded of his valet. &ldquo;It means
      that a lot of idle lacqueys and women and children start chattering in
      kitchens and shops and the market-place. A given individual ceases to be
      known as Ilya Ilyitch or Peter Petrovitch, and henceforth ranks only as
      the <i>zhenich.</i> * Yesterday no one would have noticed him, but by
      to-morrow every one will be staring at him as though he were a notorious
      rascal. Neither at the theatre nor in the street will folk let him pass
      without whispering, &lsquo;Here comes the <i>zhenich</i>! And every day other
      folk will call upon him with their faces reduced to an even greater state
      of imbecility than distinguishes yours at this moment&mdash;all in order
      that they may, vie with one another in saying imbecile things. That is how
      such an affair begins. And early each morning the zhenich must go to see
      his betrothed in lemon-coloured gloves&mdash;never at any time may he look
      untidy or weary; and always he must eat and drink what is customary under
      the circumstances, in order that his sustenance may appear to comprise
      principally bouquets and air. <i>That</i> is the programme which is
      supposed to continue fully for three or four months! How could <i>I go</i>
      through such an ordeal? Meanwhile you, Zakhar, would have had to run
      backwards and forwards between my place and my betrothed&rsquo;s, as well as to
      keep making a round of the tailors&rsquo;, the bootmakers&rsquo;, and the
      cabinetmakers&rsquo; establishments, owing to the fact that I myself could not
      have been in every spot at once. And soon the whole town would have come
      to hear of it. &lsquo;Have you yet heard the news?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oblomov is going to be
      married!&rsquo; &lsquo;Really? To whom? And what is she like? And when is the ceremony
      to be?&rsquo; Talk, talk, talk! Besides, how could I have afforded the necessary
      expenses? You know how much money I possess. Have I yet found another
      flat? And am I not owing a thousand roubles for this one? And would not
      the hire of fresh quarters have cost me three thousand roubles more,
      considering the extra rooms which would have been required? And would
      there not have been the cost of a carriage, and of a cook, and so forth?
      How could I possibly have paid for it all?&rdquo;
     </p>

     *  Bridegroom to-be.

    <p>
      Oblomov checked himself abruptly. He felt horrified to think of the
      threatening, the uncomfortable, vision which his imagination had conjured
      up. The roses, the orange-blossoms, the glitter and show, the whispers of
      the crowd&mdash;all these had faded into the background. His fond dreams,
      his peace of mind alike were gone. He could not eat or sleep, and
      everything had assumed an air of gloom and despondency. In seeking to
      overawe Zakhar, he had ended by frightening also himself, for he had
      stumbled upon the practical view of marriage, and come to perceive that,
      despite nuptial poetry, marriage constitutes an official, a very real step
      towards a serious assumption of new and insistent obligations. Unable,
      therefore, to make up his mind as to what he should say to Olga when he
      next met her, he decided to defer his visit until the following Wednesday.
      Having arrived at this decision, he felt easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, Zakhar entered the room with a letter from Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot wait until Wednesday,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I feel so lost through these
      long absences from your side that I shall look to see you in the Summer
      Gardens at three o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot go,&rdquo; he thought to himself. The next moment he comforted himself
      with the reflection that very likely, her aunt, or some other lady, would
      be with her; in which case he would have a chance of concealing his
      nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he reached the Gardens when he saw her approaching. She was
      veiled, and at first he did not recognize her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad I am that you have come!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I was afraid you would
      not do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his hand, and looked at him with an air so frank, so full of
      joy at having stolen this moment from Fate, that he felt envious of her,
      and regretful that he could not share in her lighthearted mood. Her whole
      face bespoke a childish confidence in the future, in her happiness, and in
      him. Truly she was very charming!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you look so gloomy?&rdquo; suddenly she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do you say
      nothing? I had thought you would be overjoyed to see me whereas I find you
      gone to sleep again! Wake up, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am both well and happy,&rdquo; he hastened to say&mdash;fearful lest things
      should attain the point of her guessing what was really in his mind. &ldquo;But
      I am disturbed that you should have come alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather, it is for <i>me</i> to be disturbed about that,&rdquo; she retorted.
      &ldquo;Do you think I ought to have brought my aunt with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Olga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if I had known that, I would have invited her to come,&rdquo; offendedly
      she said as she withdrew her hand from his. &ldquo;Until now I had imagined that
      your greatest happiness in life was to be with me, and with me alone. Let
      us go for a row in a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she set off towards the river, dragging his unwilling form
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming to our house to-morrow?&rdquo; she inquired when they were
      safely settled in their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Already she has divined my thoughts, and knows
      that I do not want to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning, and for the whole day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She splashed his face playfully with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How bright and cheerful everything looks!&rdquo; she remarked as she gazed
      about her. &ldquo;Let us come again to-morrow. This time I shall come straight
      from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have not come straight from home to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but from a shop, from a jeweller&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov looked alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose your aunt were to find out?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, suppose the Neva were to become dried up, and that this boat were to
      overturn, and that our house were suddenly to fall down, and that&mdash;that
      you were suddenly to lose your love for me?&rdquo; As she spoke she splashed him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Olga,&rdquo; he said when they had landed on the bank. &ldquo;At the risk of
      vexing and offending you, I ought to tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Her tone was impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we ought not to be indulging in these secret meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are betrothed to one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest Olga,&rdquo; he replied, pressing her hands, &ldquo;and therefore we are
      bound to be all the more careful. I would rather be walking with you along
      this avenue <i>publicly</i> than <i>by stealth</i>&mdash;I would rather
      see the eyes of passers-by drop respectfully before you than run the risk
      of incurring a suspicion that you have so far forgotten your modesty and
      your upbringing as to lose your head and fail in your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have <i>not</i> forgotten my modesty and my upbringing,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, withdrawing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know that you have not,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I was merely thinking of what
      people <i>might</i> say&mdash;of how the world in general <i>might</i>
      look upon it all. Pray do not misunderstand me. What I desire is that to
      the world you should seem to be as pure, as irreproachable, as in actual
      fact you are. To me your conduct seems solely honourable and modest; but
      would every one believe it to be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is right,&rdquo; she said after a pause. &ldquo;Consequently, let us
      tell my aunt to-morrow, and obtain her consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov turned pale. &ldquo;Why hurry so?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I know that, two weeks
      ago, I myself was urging haste; but at that time I had not thought of the
      necessary preparations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your heart is failing you? That I can see clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am merely cautious. Even now I see a carriage approaching us. Are
      you <i>sure</i> that the people in it are not acquaintances of yours? How
      these things throw one into a fever of perspiration I Let us depart as
      quickly as possible.&rdquo; And with that he set off, almost at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until to-morrow, then,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, until the day after to-morrow. That would be better. Or even until
      Friday or Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; you must come to-morrow. Do you hear? What have we not come to!
      What a mountain of sorrow are you not threatening to bring upon my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to go home.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n arriving at his
      rooms again, Oblomov never noticed that Zakhar gave him a cold dinner, or
      that, after it, he rolled into bed and slept heavily and insensibly; like
      a stone. Next day he received a letter in which Olga said that she had
      spent the whole night weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been unable to sleep!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Poor angel! Why
      does she care for me so much? And why am <i>I</i> so fond of <i>her</i>?
      Would we had never met! It is all Schtoltz&rsquo;s fault. He shed love over us
      as he might have shed a disease. What sort of a life is this? Nothing but
      anxiety and emotion! How can it ever lead to peaceful happiness and rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sighing deeply, he threw himself upon the sofa&mdash;then rose again, and
      went out into the street, as though seeking the normal existence which
      pursues a daily, gradual course of contemplation of nature, and
      constitutes a series of calm, scarcely perceptible phenomena of family
      life. Of existence as a spacious, a turbulent, a billowing river, as
      Schtoltz always conceived it to be, he could form no conception whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to Olga that he had taken a slight chill in the Summer Gardens&mdash;wherefore
      he must stay at home for a couple of days; but that he hoped soon to be
      better, and to see her on the following Sunday. In reply she wrote that he
      must take the greatest care of himself; that even on Sunday he must not
      come should he not be well enough; and that a whole week&rsquo;s separation
      would be bearable to her if thereby he were enabled to avoid risking his
      health. This excuse for omitting the Sunday visit Oblomov gladly seized
      upon; wherefore he sent back word that, as a matter of fact, a few days&rsquo;
      additional convalescence <i>would</i> be no more than prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day succeeded day throughout the week. He read, he walked about the
      streets, and, occasionally, he looked in upon his landlady for the purpose
      of exchanging a couple of words and drinking some of her excellent coffee.
      So comfortable did she make him that he even thought of giving her a book
      to read; but when he did so she merely read the headings of a chapter or
      two, and then returned him the volume, saying that later she would get her
      little girl to read the work to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Olga received unexpected news. This was to the effect that a
      lawsuit with regard to her property had ended in her favour, and that
      within a month&rsquo;s time she would be able, should she wish, to enter into
      actual possession. But of this, and of her other plans for the future, she
      decided not to tell Oblomov, but to spend the present hour in dreams of
      the happiness that was to be hers and his when she had seen love complete
      its revolution in his apathetic soul, and the slothfulness fall from his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day he was to come. Yet three o&rsquo;clock arrived&mdash;four o&rsquo;clock&mdash;and
      no Oblomov. By half-past five the beauty and the freshness of her features
      had begun to fade. Insensibly her form assumed a drooping posture, and as
      she sat at the table her face was pale. Yet no one noticed this. The rest
      of the guests consumed the dishes which she had prepared for him alone,
      and carried on a desultory, indifferent chatter of conversation. Until ten
      o&rsquo;clock she vacillated between hope and despair. Then, on the arrival of
      that hour, she withdrew to her room. At first she showered upon his head
      all the resentment that was seething within her. Not a word of mordant
      sarcasm in her vocabulary would she not have devoted to his punishing, had
      he been present. But after a while her mind passed from fierceness to a
      thought which chilled it like ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sick,&rdquo; was that thought. &ldquo;He is lonely and ill, and unable even to
      write.&rdquo; So much did the idea gam upon her that she passed a sleepless
      night, and rose pale, quiet, and determined. The same morning&mdash;it was
      Monday&mdash;the landlady informed Oblomov that a visitor desired to see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see <i>me?</i> Surely not?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Where is <i>she?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside. Shall I send her away?&rdquo; Oblomov was about to assent when Olga&rsquo;s
      maid, Katia, entered the room. Oblomov changed countenance. &ldquo;How come you
      to be here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress is outside,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and has sent me in to bid you go
      to her.&rdquo; There was no help for it, so he went out, and found Olga alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite well?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What has been the matter with you?&rdquo;
       With that they entered his: study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am better now&mdash;the sore throat is almost gone,&rdquo; he replied; and as
      he spoke he touched the part mentioned, and coughed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you not come last night?&rdquo; She raked him with a glance so
      keen that for the moment he found himself tongue-tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why have <i>you</i> taken such a step as this?&rdquo; he countered. &ldquo;Surely
      you know what you are doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she retorted impatiently. &ldquo;I do not believe you have been
      ill at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I have not,&rdquo; he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been deceiving me? Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain later. Important reasons have kept me away from you for a
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am afraid of scandal, of people&rsquo;s tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not of the fact that possibly I might pass sleepless nights&mdash;that
      possibly I might be so anxious as to be unable to rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot think what is passing within me,&rdquo; he said, pointing to his
      head, and then to his heart. &ldquo;I am all on edge, all on fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he told her what Zakhar had said to him, and ended with a
      statement that, like herself, he could not sleep, and that in every glance
      he saw a question, or a sneer, or a veiled hint at the relations which
      might be existing between her and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us decide to tell my aunt this week,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and at once this
      chatter will cease. Had I not known you so well, I should scarcely have
      been able to understand the fact that you can be afraid of servants&rsquo;
      gossip, yet not of making me anxious. Really I cannot understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; presently she went on. &ldquo;There is more in this than meets the
      eye. Tell me all that is in your mind. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her&mdash;then kissed her hand and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing during the past week or so?&rdquo; she persisted as
      she glanced round the room. &ldquo;What a wretched place you have got! The
      windows are small, and the curtains dirty. Where are your <i>other</i>
      rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to show her them, in the hope that he might divert her mind
      from the question of his late doings; but she only repeated the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been reading,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and writing, and thinking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you yet read <i>my</i> books?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;Where are they? I will
      take them back with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of them happened to be lying on the table. She looked at the page at
      which it was open, and saw that the page was covered with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not read them!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she looked at the mess and disorder in the room, and then
      inquired: &ldquo;Then what <i>have</i> you been doing? You have neither been
      writing nor reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have not had time to do so.. In this place, as soon as one rises,
      the rooms need to be swept, and other interruptions occur afterwards.
      Next, when dinner is over&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When dinner is over you need to go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So positive in its assurance was her tone that after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
      he replied that her conjecture was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to pass the time. You are not here with me, Olga, and life is
      wearisome and unbearable without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze became so stern that he broke off abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Ilya,&rdquo; she said very gravely. &ldquo;Do you remember saying in the park
      that at length your life had been fired to flame, and that you believed me
      to be the aim, the ideal, of your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I <i>not</i> remember it, seeing that it has revolutionized my
      whole existence? Cannot you <i>see</i> how happy I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do <i>not</i> see it,&rdquo; she replied coldly. &ldquo;Not only have you
      deceived me, but also you are letting yourself relapse into your former
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceived you? I swear to God that, were that so, I would leap into the
      pit of Hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if the pit of Hell were just beneath your feet; but, were you
      to put off doing so, even for a day or two, you would straightway change
      your mind, and become nervous about the deed&mdash;more especially should
      Zakhar and the rest begin gossiping on the subject! <i>That</i> is not
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have no idea how these cares and distractions have injured my
      health!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ever since I have known you, nothing but anxiety
      has been my lot. Yet deprivation of you would cause me to die or to go out
      of my mind. Only through you can I breathe or feel or see. Is it, then,
      wonderful that, when you are not with me, I fall ill? Without you
      everything is wearisome and distasteful. I feel like a machine, I walk and
      act without knowing ever what I am doing. Yes, I am like a machine whereof
      only you are the fuel, the motive power....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone he trod the floor as on air. &ldquo;How clearly she sees
      life!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;How unerringly from that book of wisdom is she able
      to divine her road!&rdquo; Yes, his life and hers had been bound to come
      together like two rivers, for she, and only she, was his true guide and
      instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day there arrived a letter from the lawyer on his estate. He read it
      through&mdash;then let it slip from his fingers to the ground. The gist of
      the document was that his property was greatly involved, and that, if he
      wished matters to be set in order, he must hasten to take up his residence
      on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marriage is not to be thought of for at least another year,&rdquo; he
      reflected with dismay. &ldquo;First of all I shall need to complete my plans for
      the estate, and then to consult an architect, and then, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off with a sigh.

      hesitation in his tone: &ldquo;But perhaps within a year or so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within a year or so you may be able to order your life and your affairs?
      Reflect a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, for he was fighting a battle with himself, and the battle was
      reflected in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Remember that you and I are no longer children,
      and that we are not jesting, and that the matter may affect our whole
      lives. Inquire sternly of your conscience, therefore, and tell me (for I
      know you, as well as trust you) whether you can stand by me your life
      long, and be to me all that I need? You know me as I know you:
      consequently you understand what it is that I am trying to say. Should you
      return me a bold, a considered &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I will cancel a certain decision of
      mine&mdash;I will give you my hand, and together we will go abroad, or to
      your estate, or to the Veaborg Quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if you knew how much I love you!&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire no protestations of love.&mdash;only a brief answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not torture me, Olga,&rdquo; he cried with weariness in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then am I right in what I suppose?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are right,&rdquo; was the firm, but significant, reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what you would have done had we married?&rdquo; at length she
      said. &ldquo;Day by day you would have relapsed farther and farther into your
      slough. And I? You see what I am&mdash;that I am not yet grown old, and
      that I shall never cease to <i>live</i>. But you would have taken to
      waiting for Christmas, and then for Shrovetide, and to attending evening
      parties, and to dancing, and to thinking of nothing at all. You would have
      retired to rest each night with a sigh of thankfulness that the day had
      passed so quickly; and each morning you would have awakened with a prayer
      that to-day might be exactly as yesterday. <i>That</i> would have been our
      future. Is it not so? Meanwhile I should have been fading away. Do you <i>really</i>
      think that in such a life you would have been happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to rise and leave the room, but his feet refused their office. He
      tried to say something, but his throat seemed dry, and no sound would
      come. All he could do was to stretch out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She too tried to speak, but could not. She too tried to extend her hand,
      but it fell back. Finally, her face contracted painfully, and, sinking
      forward upon his shoulder, she burst into a storm of sobbing. It was as
      though all her weapons had slipped from her grasp, and once more she was
      just a woman&mdash;a woman defenceless in her fight with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye!&rdquo; she said amid her spasms of weeping. He sat
      listening painfully to her sobs, but felt as though he could say nothing
      to check them. Sinking into a chair, and burying her face in her
      handkerchief, she wept bitter, burning tears, with her head bowed upon the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga,&rdquo; at length he said, &ldquo;why, torture yourself in this way? You love
      me, and could never survive a parting. Take me, therefore, as I am, and
      love in me just so much as may be worthy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without raising her head, she made a gesture of refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she forced herself to gasp. &ldquo;Nor need you fear for me and my
      grief. I know myself. I am merely weeping my heart out, and shall then
      weep no more. Do not hinder me, but go. God has punished me. Yet how it
      hurts, how it hurts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sobs redoubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the pain should <i>not</i> pass?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Suppose it should
      wreck your health? Tears like these are tears of poison. Olga, darling, do
      not weep. Forget the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; let me weep. I am weeping not so much for the future as for the
      past.&rdquo; She could scarcely utter the words. &ldquo;It was all so bright&mdash;but
      now it is gone! It is not I that am weeping; it is my memory&mdash;my
      memory of the summer, of the park&mdash;that is pouring out its grief. Do
      you remember those things? Yes, I am yearning for the avenue, and for the
      lilac that you gave me... They had struck their roots into my heart, and&mdash;and
      the plucking of them up is painful indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her despair she bowed her head, and sobbed again&mdash;repeating: &ldquo;Oh,
      how it hurts! Oh, how it hurts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you were to die of this?&rdquo; he said in sudden alarm. &ldquo;Olga,
      Olga! Think a moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she interrupted, raising her head, and striving to look at him
      through her tears. &ldquo;Not long ago I realized that I was loving in you only
      what I wished you to contain&mdash;that it was only the future Oblomov of
      my dreams that was so dear to me. Ilya, you are good and honourable and
      tender; but you are all this only as is a dove which, with its head hidden
      under its wing, wishes to see nothing better. All your life you would have
      sat perched beneath the eaves. But I am different&mdash;I wish for more
      than that; though what it is I wish for even I myself could scarcely say.
      On the other hand, do you think that <i>you</i> could have taught me what
      that something is, that <i>you</i> could have supplied me with what I
      lack, that <i>you</i> could have given me all that I&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov&rsquo;s legs were tottering under him. Sinking into a chair, he wiped
      his hands and forehead with his handkerchief. The words had been harsh&mdash;they
      had stung him to the quick. Somehow, too, they had seared him inwardly,
      while outwardly, they had chilled him as with a breath of frost. No more
      could he do than smile the sort of pitiful, deprecating smile which may be
      seen on the face of a beggar who is being rated for his sorry clothing&mdash;the
      sort of smile which says: &ldquo;I am poor and naked and hungry. Beat me,
      therefore&mdash;beat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Olga realized the sting which her words had contained, and threw
      herself impetuously upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my friend,&rdquo; she said tenderly and with tears in her voice. &ldquo;I
      did not think what I was saying, for I am almost beside myself. Yes,
      forget all that has happened, and let us be as formerly&mdash;let all
      remain unchanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, as abruptly he rose to his feet and checked her outburst
      with a decisive gesture. &ldquo;All <i>cannot</i> remain unchanged. Nor need you
      regret that you have told me the truth. I have well deserved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a renewed fit of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said, twisting her tear-soaked handkerchief in her hands. &ldquo;I
      cannot bear this any longer. To <i>me</i> at least the past is dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face, and the sobs poured forth afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has everything thus come to rack and ruin?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Who has put a
      curse upon you, Ilya? Why have you done this? You are clever and kind and
      good and noble; yet you can wreck our lives in this way! What nameless
      evil has undone you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has a name,&rdquo; he said almost inaudibly. She looked at him questioningly
      with tear-filled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That name,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is &lsquo;The Disease of Oblomovka.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning with bowed head, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither he wandered, or what he did, he never afterwards knew. Late at
      night he returned home. His landlady, hearing his knock, awoke Zakhar, who
      undressed his master, and wrapped him in the old dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes that to be here?&rdquo; asked Oblomov, glancing at the garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was given it by the landlady to-day,&rdquo; replied Zakhar. &ldquo;She has just
      cleaned and mended it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sinking into an arm-chair, Oblomov remained there. All around was growing
      dim and dreamlike. As he sat there with his head resting on his hand he
      neither remarked the dimness nor heard the striking of the hours. All his
      mind was plunged in a chaos of formless, indefinite thoughts which, like
      the clouds in the sky, passed aimlessly, disconnectedly athwart the
      surface of his brain. Of none of them could he catch the actual substance.
      His heart felt crushed, and for the moment the life in it was in abeyance.
      Mechanically he gazed in front of him without even noticing that day was
      breaking, or that his landlady&rsquo;s dry cough was once more audible, or that
      the <i>dvornik</i> was beginning to cut firewood in the courtyard, or that
      the usual clatter in the house had begun again. At length he went to bed,
      and fell into a leaden, an uncomfortable sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day is Sunday,&rdquo; whispered the kindly voice of the landlady, &ldquo;and I
      have baked you a pie. Will you not have some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned no answer, for he was in a high fever.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span> or many a day
      after his illness Oblomov&rsquo;s mood was one of dull and painful despondency;
      but gradually this became replaced with a phase of mute indifference, in
      which he would spend hours in watching the snow fall and listening to the
      grinding of the landlady&rsquo;s coffee-mill, to the barking of the housedogs as
      they rattled at their chains, to the creaking of Zakhar&rsquo;s boots, and to
      the measured tick of the clock&rsquo;s pendulum. As of old, Agafia Matvievna,
      his landlady, would come and propose one or another dish for his
      delectation; also her children would come running to and fro through his
      rooms. To the landlady he returned kindly, indifferent answers, and to the
      youngsters he gave lessons in reading and waiting, while smiling wearily,
      involuntarily at their playfulness. Little by little he regained his
      firmer mode of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Schtoltz walked into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ilya?&rdquo; he said, with a questioning sternness which caused Oblomov
      to lower his eyes and remain silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is to be &lsquo;never&rsquo;?&rdquo; went on his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never&rsquo;?&rdquo; queried Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you not remember my saying to you, &lsquo;Now or never&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the other returned. &ldquo;But I am not the man I then was. I have now
      set my affairs in order, and my plans for improving my estate are nearly
      finished, and I write regularly for two journals, and I have read all the
      books which you left behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why have you never come to join me abroad?&rdquo; asked Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something prevented me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov gathered animation at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I heard that she had gone abroad with her
      aunt&mdash;that she went there soon after, after&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon after she had recognized her mistake,&rdquo; concluded Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the story, then?&rdquo; said Oblomov, scarcely able to conceal his
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the whole of it&mdash;even to the point of the sprig of lilac. Do
      you not feel ashamed of yourself, Ilya? Does it not hurt you? Are you not
      consumed with regret and remorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; please do not remind me of it,&rdquo; interrupted Oblomov hurriedly. &ldquo;So
      great was my agony when I perceived the gulf set between us that I fell
      ill of a fever. Ah, Schtoltz, if you love me, do not torture me, do not
      mention her name. Long ago I pointed out to her her mistake, but she would
      not listen to me. Indeed I am not so much to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not blaming you,&rdquo; said Schtoltz gently; &ldquo;for I have read your
      letter. It is I that am most to blame&mdash;then she&mdash;then you least
      of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she? She is in great distress. She weeps, and will not be
      comforted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mingled anguish, sympathy, and alarm showed themselves on Oblomov&rsquo;s
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Come, Schtoltz! We must go to her
      at once, in order that I may beg her pardon on my knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schtoltz thought it well to change his tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sit still,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;I have not been telling you the
      exact truth. As a matter of fact, she is well and happy, and bids me give
      you her greeting. Also, she wanted to write to you, but I dissuaded her on
      the ground that it would only cause you pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; cried Oblomov, almost with tears of joy. &ldquo;Oh, I am
      so glad, Schtollz! Pray let me embrace you, and then let us drink to her
      happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you hidden away in this corner?&rdquo; asked Sehtoltz after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is quiet here&mdash;there is no one to disturb me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; retorted Sehtoltz. &ldquo;In fact, you have here&mdash;well,
      Oblomovka over again, only worse.&rdquo; He glanced about him. &ldquo;And how are you
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very well. My breathing is bad, and spots persist in floating
      before my eyes. Sometimes, too, when I am asleep, some one seems to come
      and strike me a blow upon the back and head, so that I leap up with a
      start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Ilya,&rdquo; said Schtoltz gravely. &ldquo;I tell you, in all seriousness,
      that if you do not change your mode of life you will soon be seized with
      dropsy or a stroke. As for your future, I have no hopes of it at all. If
      Olga, that angel, could not bear you from your swamp on her wings, neither
      shall I succeed in doing so. However, to the end I shall stand by you: and
      when I say that, I am voicing not only my own wish, but also that of Olga.
      For she desires you not to perish utterly, not to be buried alive; she
      desires that at least I shall make an attempt to dig you from the tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has not forgotten me?&rdquo; cried Oblomov with emotion&mdash;adding:
      &ldquo;As though I were worthy of her remembrance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she has not forgotten you, and, I think, never will. Indeed, she is
      not the sort of person to forget you. Some day you must go and pay her a
      visit in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;but not now,&rdquo; urged Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even at this moment I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He pointed to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it contain?&rdquo; asked Sehtoltz. &ldquo;Love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, shame and sorrow. Ah, life, life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It disturbs me&mdash;it allows me no rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it to do so, the flame of your candle would soon go out, and you
      would find yourself in darkness. Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Life passes too swiftly
      for it to be spent in slumber. Would, rather, it were a perpetual fire!&mdash;that
      one could live for hundreds and hundreds of years! <i>Then</i> what an
      immensity of work would one not do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I are of different types,&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;<i>You</i> have wings;
      you do not merely exist&mdash;you also fly. You have gifts and ambition;
      you do not grow fat; specks do not dance before your eyes; and the back of
      your neck does not need to be periodically scratched. In short, my
      organism and yours are wholly dissimilar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie! Man was created to order his own being, and even to change his
      own nature; yet, instead, he goes and develops a paunch, and then supposes
      that nature has laid upon him that burden. Once upon a time you too had
      wings. Now you have laid them aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; asked Oblomov. &ldquo;I am powerless, completely powerless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather, you are <i>determined</i> to be powerless. Even during your
      boyhood at Oblomovka, and amid the circle of your aunts and nurses and
      valets, you had begun to waste your intellect, and to be unable to put on
      your own socks, and so forth. Hence your present inability to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that may be so,&rdquo; said Oblomov with a sigh; &ldquo;but now it is too late to
      turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I to say to Olga on my return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov hung his head in sad and silent meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing,&rdquo; at length he said. &ldquo;Or say that you have not seen me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A year and a half later Oblomov was sitting in his dull, murky rooms. He
      had now grown corpulent, and from his eyes <i>ennui</i> peered forth like
      a disease. At intervals, too, he would rise and pace the room, then lie
      down again, then take a book from the table, read a few lines of it, yawn,
      and begin drumming with his fingers upon the table&rsquo;s surface. As for
      Zakhar, he was more seedy and untidy than ever. The elbows of his coat
      were patched, and he had about him a pinched and hungry air, as though his
      appetite were bad, his sleep poor, and his work three times as much as it
      ought to have been. Oblomov&rsquo;s dressing-gown also was patched: yet,
      carefully though the holes had been mended, the seams were coming apart in
      various places. Likewise the coverlet of the bed was ragged, while the
      curtains, though clean, were faded and hanging in strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the landlady entered to announce a visitor, and also to say that
      it was neither Tarantiev nor Alexiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be Schtoltz again!&rdquo; thought Oblomov, with a sense of horror.
      &ldquo;What can he want with me? However, it does not matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; inquired Schtoltz when he entered the room. &ldquo;You have grown
      stout, yet your face is pale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am not well,&rdquo; agreed Oblomov. &ldquo;Somehow my left leg has lost all
      feeling.&rdquo; Schtoltz threw at him a keen glance, and then eyed the
      dressing-gown, the curtains, and the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Oblomov confusedly. &ldquo;You know that never at any time do
      I keep my place tidy. But how is Olga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not forgotten you. Possibly you will end by forgetting <i>her?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never! Never could I forget the time when I was really alive and
      living in Paradise. Where is she, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and also with her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she is married? Has she been married long? And is she happy?&rdquo; Oblomov
      had quite sloughed his lethargy. &ldquo;I feel as though you had removed a great
      burden from my mind. True, when you were last here, you assured me that
      she had forgiven me; but all this time I have been unable to rest for the
      gnawing at my heart.... Tell me who the fortunate man is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who he is?&rdquo; repeated Schtoltz. &ldquo;Why, cannot you guess, Ilya!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov&rsquo;s gaze grew more intent, and for a moment or two his features
      stiffened, and every vestige of colour left his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it is not yourself?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. I married her last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agitation faded from Oblomov&rsquo;s expression, and gave place to his usual
      apathetic moodiness. For a moment or two he did not raise his eyes; but
      when he did so they were full of kindly tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Schtoltz!&rdquo; he cried, embracing his friend. &ldquo;And dear Olga! May God
      bless you both! How pleased I am! Pray tell her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell her that in all the world there exists not my friend
      Oblomov&rsquo;s equal.&rdquo; Schtoltz was profoundly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, tell her, rather, that I was fated to meet her, in order that I might
      set her on the right road. Tell her also that I bless both that meeting
      and the road which she has now taken. To think that that road might have
      been different! As it is, I have nothing to blush for, and nothing of
      which to repent. You have relieved my soul of a great burden, and all
      within it is bright. I thank you, I thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> tell her what you have said,&rdquo; replied Schtoltz. &ldquo;She has
      indeed reason for never forgetting you, for you would have been worthy of
      her&mdash;yes, worthy of her, you who have a heart as deep as the sea. You
      must come and visit us in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;It is not that I am afraid of witnessing your
      married happiness, or of becoming jealous of her love for you. Yet I will
      not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then of what are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of growing envious of you. In your happiness I should see, as in a
      mirror, my own bitter, broken life. Yet no life but this do I wish, or
      have it in my power, to live. Do not, therefore, disturb it. Memories are
      the height of poetry only when they are memories of happiness. When they
      graze wounds over which scars have formed they become an aching pain. Let
      us speak of something else. Let me thank you for all the care and
      attention which you have devoted to my affairs. Yet never can I properly
      requite you. Seek, rather, requital in your own heart, and in your
      happiness with Olga Sergievna. Likewise, forgive me for having failed to
      relieve you of your duties with regard to Oblomovka. It is my fixed
      intention to go there before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find great changes occurred in the place. Doubtless you have
      read the statements of accounts which I have sent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You have <i>not</i> read them?&rdquo; exclaimed Schtollz, aghast. &ldquo;Then
      where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. Wait a little, and I will look for them after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Scarcely do I know whether to laugh or to weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. We will attend to the affair after dinner. First let us eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the meal Oblomov bestowed high encomiums upon his landlady&rsquo;s
      cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks after everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never will you see me either with
      unmended socks or with a shirt turned inside out. She supervises every
      detail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ate and drank with great gusto&mdash;so much so that Schtoltz
      contemplated him with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, dear friend, drink,&rdquo; said Oblomov. &ldquo;This is splendid <i>vodka</i>.
      Even Olga could not make <i>vodka</i> or patties or mushroom stews equal
      to these. They are like what we used to have at Oblomovka. No man could be
      better looked after by a woman than I am by my landlady, Agafia Matvievna.
      Nevertheless I, I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; prompted Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe her ten thousand roubles on note of hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand roubles? To your landlady? For board and lodging?&rdquo; gasped
      Schtoltz, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see, the sum has gone on accumulating, for I live generously,
      and the debt includes accounts for peaches, pineapples, and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ilya,&rdquo; said Schtoltz, &ldquo;<i>what</i> is this woman to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is robbing him,&rdquo; thought his friend. &ldquo;She is wheedling his all out of
      him. Such things are everyday, occurrences, yet I had not guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desirous of taking Oblomov away with him, he nevertheless found all his
      efforts in that direction ineffectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you once again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In what relation do you stand to your
      landlady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Oblomov reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you desirous of knowing?&rdquo; he countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, on the score of our old friendship, I think it my duty to give
      you a very serious warning indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warning against what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warning against a pit into which you may fall, Now I must be going. I
      will tell Olga that we may expect to see you this summer whether at our
      place or at Oblomovka.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Schtoltz departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for some years did he visit the capital again, for Olga&rsquo;s health
      necessitated a lengthy sojourn in the Crimea. For some reason or other her
      recovery after the birth of a child had been slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy I am!&rdquo; was her frequent reflection. Yet, no sooner had she
      passed her life in admiring review than she would find herself relapsing
      into a meditative mood. What a curious person she was!&mdash;a person who,
      in proportion as her felicity became more, complete, plunged ever deeper
      and deeper into a brooding over the past! Delving mto the recesses of her
      own mind, she began to realize that this peaceful existence, this halting
      at various stages of felicity, annoyed her. However, with an effort of
      will she shook her soul clear of this despondency, and quickened her steps
      through life in a feverish desire to seek noise and movement and
      occupation. Yet the bustle of society brought her small relief, and she
      would retire again into her corner&mdash;there to rid her spirit of the
      unwonted sense of depression. Then she would go out once more, and busy
      herself with petty household cares which confined her to the nursery and
      the duties of a nurse and a mother, or join her husband in reading and
      discussing serious books or poetry. Her main fear was lest she should fall
      ill of the disease, the apathetic malady, of Oblomovka. Yet, for all her
      efforts to slough these phases of torpor and of spiritual coma, a dream of
      happiness other than the present used to steal upon her, and wrap her in a
      haze of inertia, and cause her whole being to halt, as for a rest from the
      exertions of lire. Again, to this mood there would succeed a phase of
      torture and weariness and apprehension&mdash;a phase of dull sorrowfulness
      which kept asking itself dim, indefinite questions and ceaselessly
      pondering upon them. And as she listened to those questions she would
      examine herself, yet never discover what it was she yearned for, nor why,
      at times, she seemed to tire of her comfortable existence, to demand of it
      new and unfamiliar impressions, and to be gazing ahead in search of
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; she would say to herself with a shudder. &ldquo;Is
      there really anything more that I require, or that I need wish for?
      Whither am I travelling? I have no farther to go&mdash;my journey is
      ended. Yet have I <i>really</i> completed my cycle of existence? Is this
      <i>really</i> all&mdash;all?&rdquo; Then she would glance timidly around her,
      and wonder, in doubt and trembling, what such whispers of the soul might
      portend. With anxious eyes she would scan the earth, the heavens, and the
      wilds, yet find therein no answer, but merely gloom, profundity, and
      remoteness. All nature seemed to be saying the same thing; in nature she
      could perceive only a ceaseless, uniform current of life to which there
      was neither a beginning nor an ending. Of course, she knew whom she could
      consult concerning these tremors&mdash;she knew who could return the
      needed answers to her questionings. But what would those answers import?
      What if Schtoltz should say that her self-questionings represented the
      murmurings of an unsympathetic, an unwomanly, heart&mdash;that his quondam
      idol possessed but a <i>blasé</i>, dissatisfied soul from which nothing
      good was to be looked for? Yes, how greatly she might fall in his
      estimation, were he to discover these new and unwonted pangs of hers!
      Consequently, whenever, in spite of her best efforts to conceal the fact,
      her eyes lost their velvety softness, and acquired a dry and feverish
      glitter; whenever, too, a heavy cloud overspread her face, and she could
      not force herself to smile, and to talk, and to listen indifferently to
      the latest news in the political world, or to descriptions of interesting
      phenomena in some new walk of learning, or to remarks upon some new
      creation of art&mdash;well, then she hid herself away, on the plea of
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she felt no desire to give way to tears; she experienced none of those
      sudden alarms which had been hers during the period when her girlish
      nerves had been excited even to the point of self-expression. So if, while
      resting on some calm, beautiful evening, there came stealing upon her,
      even amid her husband&rsquo;s talk and caresses, a feeling of weariness and
      indifference to everything, she would merely ask herself despairingly what
      it all meant. At one moment she would become, as it were, turned to stone,
      and sit silent; at another she would make feverish attempts to conceal her
      strange malady. Finally a headache would supervene, and she would retire
      to rest. Yet all the while it was a difficult matter for her to evade the
      keen eyes of her husband. This she knew well, and therefore prepared
      herself for conversation with him as nervously as she would have done for
      confession to a priest.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne evening she and
      Schtoltz were pacing the poplar avenue in their garden. She was suffering
      from her usual inexplicable lack of energy, and finding herself able to
      return but the briefest of answers to what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;the nurse tells me that Olinka is troubled
      with a night cough. Ought we not to send for the doctor to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have given her some hot medicine, and am going to keep her indoors
      for the present,&rdquo; answered Olga dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence they walked to the end of the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you sent no reply to that letter from your friend Sonichka?&rdquo; he
      inquired. &ldquo;This is the third letter that you have left unanswered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather forget her altogether,&rdquo; was Olga&rsquo;s brief rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not well?&rdquo; he continued after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; nothing is the matter with me. Why should you think otherwise&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are <i>ennuyée?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of assumed cheerfulness&mdash;yet a tone in
      which the note of <i>ennui</i> was only too plainly apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her clear of the shade of the trees, and turned her face to the
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he commanded. He gazed intently into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would say that you were unhappy,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Your eyes have a
      strange expression in them which I have noticed more than once before.
      What is the matter with you, Olga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took him by the sleeve and drew him back into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware,&rdquo; she said with forced gaiety, &ldquo;that I am hungry for
      supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Do not make a jest of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy, indeed?&rdquo; she said reproachfully, halting in front of him. &ldquo;Yes,
      I <i>am</i> unhappy&mdash;but only from excess of happiness.&rdquo; So tender
      was her tone, and so caressing the note in her voice, that he bent down
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she grew bolder. The jesting supposition that she could be
      unhappy inspired her to greater frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not <i>ennuyée</i>,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;nor should I ever be so. You
      know that well, yet you refuse to believe my words. Nor am I ill. It is
      merely that, that well, that sometimes a feeling of depression comes over
      me. You are a difficult man to conceal things from. Sometimes I feel
      depressed, though I could not say why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her head upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, what <i>is</i> the reason of it?&rdquo; he asked her gently as he
      bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there <i>must</i> be a reason of some sort. If that reason lies
      neither in me nor in your surroundings, it must lie in yourself. Sometimes
      such depression is a symptom of ill-health. Are you <i>sure</i> that you
      are quite well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events I feel so,&rdquo; she replied gravely. &ldquo;See for yourself how I
      eat and walk and sleep and work! Yet every now and then there comes over
      me a mood in which life seems to me incomplete.... Do not mind this,
      however. It is nothing&mdash;nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Certainly life is incomplete, but what would
      you add to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I grow afraid lest everything should be
      about to be changed, or to come to an end; while at other times I find
      myself torturing my brain with a stupid wondering as to what more is to be
      expected from the future, this happiness of ours, this life, with its joys
      and sorrows&rdquo;&mdash;she had dropped her voice to a whisper, in a sort of
      shame at her own questionings&mdash;&ldquo;I know to be quite natural; yet
      something seems still to be drawing me onwards, and to be making me
      dissatisfied with my lot. How ashamed I feel of my folly and fancifulness!
      But do not notice me: this despondency of mine will soon pass away, and I
      shall once more become bright and cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed herself closer with a timid caress, as though she were asking
      pardon for what she termed her &ldquo;folly.&rdquo; He questioned her as to her
      symptoms as a physician might have done, and, in return, she described to
      him her dull self-interrogations, her confusion of soul. Meanwhile
      Schtollz paced the avenue with his head on his breast and his mind filled
      with doubt and anxiety&mdash;anxiety at the fact that he so little
      understood his wife. At length she, in her turn, drew him into the light
      of the moon, and gazed inquiringly into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; she asked bashfully. &ldquo;Are you smiling at my
      foolishness? Yes, &rsquo;tis very foolish, this despondency of mine. Do
      you not think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not speak?&rdquo; she urged impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have long been keeping silence,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;although always you
      have known how solicitous I am on your account. Permit <i>me</i>,
      therefore, to keep silence and reflect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, if you do that, I shall feel uneasy. Never ought I to have spoken
      out. Pray say <i>something</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to say?&rdquo; he asked meditatively. &ldquo;It may be that a nervous break
      down is hanging over you. Should that be so, the doctor, not I, will have
      to decide how best you can be treated. I will send for him to-morrow. In
      any case, if the mischief is not that, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; she queried, shaking his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over-imagination on your part. You are too full of life and
      hitherto been maturing.&rdquo; He was speaking rather to himself than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray utter your thoughts aloud, Andrei,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over&mdash;I am still maturing,&rdquo; she said beseechingly. &ldquo;I cannot
      bear it when you go muttering to yourself like that. I have told you of my
      follies, and you merely bow your head and mumble something into your
      beard. In this dark spot such conduct makes me feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at a loss what to say. You tell me, &lsquo;Depression comes over me,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;I find myself troubled with disturbing questions.&rsquo; What am I to make of
      that? Let us speak on the subject again later, and in the meanwhile
      consider matters. Possibly you require a course of sea-bathing, or
      something of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said to yourself: &lsquo;Hitherto you have been maturing.&rsquo; What did you
      mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking that, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He spoke slowly and
      hesitatingly, as though he were distrustful of his own thoughts and
      ashamed of his own words. &ldquo;You see, there are moments when symptoms of
      this kind betoken that, if a woman has nothing radically wrong with her
      health, she has reached maturity&mdash;has arrived at the stage when
      life&rsquo;s growth becomes arrested, and there remains for her no further
      problem to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you mean that I am growing old?&rdquo; she interrupted sharply. &ldquo;How can
      you say that? I am still young and strong.&rdquo; And she drew herself up as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are not of the kind that will ever grow old.
      True, in old age one&rsquo;s energies fail, and one ceases to battle with life;
      but that is a very different thing. Provided it be what I take it to be,
      your sense of depression and weariness is a sign of vigour. Frequently the
      growings of a vivid, excitable intellect transcend the limits of everyday
      existence, and, finding no answer to what that intellect demands of life,
      become converted into despondency and a temporary dissatisfaction with
      life. The meaning of it is that the soul is sorrowful at having to ask
      life its secret. Perhaps such is the case with <i>you</i>. If so, you need
      not term it folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, but, apparently, with relief at the thought that the danger
      was over, and that she had not fallen in her husband&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite happy,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;nor do I spend my time in dreaming, nor
      is my life monotonous. What more, then, is there for me to have? What do
      these questionings portend? They harass me like a sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a spur to encourage a weak, groping intellect which has lacked
      full preparation. True, such depression and selfquestionings have caused
      many to lose their senses; but to others they seem mere formless visions,
      a mere fever of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that just when one&rsquo;s happiness is full to overflowing, and one
      is thoroughly in love with life, there should come upon one a taint of
      sorrow!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; such is the payment exacted for the Promethean fire. You must not
      only endure, you must even love and respect, the sorrow and the doubts and
      the self-questionings of which you have spoken: for they constitute the
      excess, the luxury, of life, and show themselves most when happiness is at
      its zenith, and has alloyed with it no gross desires. Such troubles are
      powerless to spring to birth amid life which is ordinary and everyday;
      they cannot touch the individual who is forced to endure hardship and
      want. That is why the bulk of the crowd goes on its way without ever
      experiencing the cloud of doubt, the pain of self-questioning. To him or
      to her, however, who <i>voluntarily</i> goes to meet those difficulties
      they become welcome guests, not a scourge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one can never get even with them. To almost every one they bring
      sorrow and indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but that does not last. Later they serve to shed light upon life,
      for they lead one to the edge of the abyss whence there is no return&mdash;then
      gently force one to turn once more and look upon life. Thus they seem to
      challenge one&rsquo;s tried faculties in order that the latter may be prevented
      from sinking wholly into inertia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think, also, that one should be disturbed by phantoms at all!&rdquo; she
      lamented. &ldquo;When all is bright, one&rsquo;s life suddenly becomes overshadowed
      with some sinister influence. Is there <i>no</i> resource against it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is one. That resource lies in life itself. Without such
      phantoms and such questionings life would soon become a wearisome
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what ought I to do? To submit to them, and to wear out my heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Rather, arm yourself with resolution, and patiently,
      but firmly, pursue your way.&rdquo; With that he embraced her tenderly. &ldquo;You and
      I are not Titans; it is not for us to join the Manfreds and the Fausts of
      this world in going out to do battle with rebellious problems. Rather, let
      us decline the challenge of such difficulties, bow our heads, and quietly
      live through the juncture until such time as life shall have come to smile
      again, and happiness be once more ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose they decline to pass us by? Will not our doubts and fears
      continue to increase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for we shall accept them as a new verse in life&rsquo;s poem. In this case,
      however, there is no fear of that. Your trouble is not peculiar to you
      alone; it is an infectious malady common to all humanity, of which a touch
      has visited you with the rest. Invariably does a human being feel lost
      when he or she first breaks away from life and finds no support in place
      of it. May God send that in the present instance this mood of yours be
      what I believe it to be, and not a forerunner of some bodily illness. That
      would be worse, for it would be the one thing before which I should be
      nerveless and destitute of weapons. Surely that cloud, that depression,
      those doubts, those self-questionings of yours, are not going to deprive
      us of our happiness, of our&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; before he could do so,
      she had flung herself upon him in a frantic embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing shall <i>ever</i> do that!&rdquo; she murmured in an access of renewed
      joy and confidence. &ldquo;No, neither doubts nor sorrow nor sickness! No, nor
      yet&mdash;nor yet death itself!&rdquo; Never had she seemed to love him as she
      did at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care that Fate does not overhear what you have whispered,&rdquo; he
      interposed with a superstitious caution born of tender forethought for
      her. &ldquo;Yes, take care that it does not rate you ungrateful, for it likes to
      have its gifts appreciated at their true worth. Hitherto you have been <i>learning</i>
      only about life: now you are going also to experience it. Soon, as life
      pursues its course, there will come to you fresh sorrows and travail; and,
      together, they will force you to look beyond the questions of which you
      have spoken, and therefore you must husband your strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schtoitz uttered these words softly, and almost as though he were speaking
      to himself. And in the words was a note of despondency which seemed to say
      that already he could see approaching her &ldquo;sorrows&rdquo; and &ldquo;travail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing&mdash;she was too deeply struck with the mournful
      foreboding in his tone. Yet she trusted him implicitly&mdash;his voice
      alone inspired in her belief; and for that very reason his gravity
      affected her deeply, and concentrated her thoughts upon herself. Leaning
      upon him, she paced the avenue slowly and mechanically, with her soul awed
      to a silence which she could not break. Following her husband&rsquo;s eyes, she
      was gazing forward at the vista of life, and trying to discern the point
      where, according to his words, &ldquo;sorrows and travail&rdquo; were awaiting her.
      And as she did so she saw arise before her a vision in which there became
      revealed to her a sphere of life that was no longer to be bright and
      leisured and protected, that was no longer to be passed amid plenty, that
      was no longer to be spent alone with him. In that sphere she could descry
      only a long sequence of losses and privations, with copious tears, strict
      asceticism, involuntary, renunciation of whims born of hours of ease, and
      new and unwonted sensations which should call forth from her cries of pain
      and disappointment. Yes, in that vision she saw before her only sickness,
      material ruin, the loss of her husband, and...
    </p>
    <p>
      Shuddering and faltering, she, with a man&rsquo;s courageous curiosity,
      continued to gaze at this unfamiliar presentment of life, and timidly to
      review and to estimate her ability to cope with it. Only love, she saw,
      would never fail her&mdash;only love would over this new existence keep
      ever-faithful watch and ward. Yet it would be love of a different kind.
      From it there would be absent all ardent sighs and shining days and
      rapturous nights; as the years went on such things would come to seem
      children&rsquo;s sport compared with the non-intimate affection which life, now
      grown profound and menacing, would cause her to adopt for her guide. From
      that life came to her ears no sound of laughter and kisses and tremulous,
      soulful intercourse amid groves and flowers, while life and nature kept
      high holiday. No, such things were &ldquo;withered and gone.&rdquo; The love beheld in
      that vision was a love which, unfading and indestructible, expressed
      itself on the features of husband and wife only during seasons of mutual
      sorrow, and shone forth only in slow, silent glances of mutual sympathy,
      and voiced itself only in a constant, joint endurance of the trials of
      life as he and she restrained the tears, and choked back the sobs, which
      those trials called forth. With that there came stealing into the midst of
      the doubts and fears which beset her other visions&mdash;visions remote
      but clear, inspiring but definite....

      Her husband&rsquo;s calm, assured reasoning, added to her own implicit
      confidence in him, helped Olga to succeed in shaking off both her
      enigmatical, singular misgivings and her visionary, menacing dreams
      concerning the future. Once more, therefore, she strode boldly forward. To
      the night of doubt there succeeded a brilliant morning of maternal and
      housewifely duties. On the one hand, there beckoned to her the flower
      garden and the meadows; on the other hand there beckoned to her her
      husband&rsquo;s study. No longer did she play with life as with a means of
      carefree indulgence. Rather, life had become a season of mysterious,
      systematic waiting, and of getting ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet once, when Schtoltz happened to mention Oblomov&rsquo;s name, she let fall
      her sewing, and sank into a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; later she asked. &ldquo;Could we not find out how he is through
      some of his friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, we should find out no more than we know already. Independently
      of his friends, I happen to be aware that he is alive and well, and living
      in the same rooms as formerly. But how he is spending his days, and
      whether he is morally dead or still there is flickering in him a last
      spark of vitality, it is impossible for an outsider to ascertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak like that, Andrei,&rdquo; said Olga. &ldquo;It hurts me to hear you do
      so. Were I not afraid, I would go in person to glean news of him.&rdquo; The
      tears had risen very near to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next spring we ourselves shall be in Petrograd,&rdquo; the husband remarked. &ldquo;<i>Then</i>
      we will find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not sufficient merely to find out: we ought also to do all we
      can for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already I have done what is possible. When one is with him he is ready to
      take any steps desired; but directly one&rsquo;s back is turned he relapses into
      slumber. &rsquo;Tis like trying to deal with a drunken man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why turn your back upon him <i>ever?</i> He ought to be treated
      firmly&mdash;he ought to, be removed from his rooms and taken away. Were I
      to ask him, he would come with us into the country. I feel sure I should
      never get over it if I were to see him sink to rack and ruin. Perhaps my
      tears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might revive him, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but at least compel him to look around him, and to exchange his life
      for something better. With us he would be out of the mire, and living
      among his equals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you do not love him as you used to do?&rdquo; Schtoltz asked
      half-jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; she replied (and as she did so her grave eyes seemed to be
      gazing back into the past). &ldquo;Yet in him there is something for which I
      have an abiding affection, and to which I shall ever remain true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what that something is?&rdquo; She nodded an assent.&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
      an honourable, trustworthy heart. That heart is the nugget given him of
      Nature, and he has carried it unsullied through all his life. Under life&rsquo;s
      stress he fell, lost his enthusiasm, and ended by going to sleep&mdash;a
      broken, disenchanted man who had lost his power to live, but not his
      purity and his intrinsic worth. Never a false note has that heart sounded;
      never a particle of mire has there clung to his soul; never a specious lie
      has he heeded; never to the false road has he been seduced by any possible
      attraction. Even were a whole ocean of evil and rascality to come seething
      about him, and even were the whole world to become infected with poison
      and be turned upside down, Oblomov would yet refuse to bow to the false
      image, and his soul would remain as clean, as radiant, and as without spot
      as ever. That soul is a soul of crystal transparency. Of men like him but
      few exist, so that they shine amid the mob like pearls. No price could be
      high enough to purchase his heart. Everywhere and always that heart would
      remain true to its trust. It is to this element in him that you have
      always remained true; and it is owing to the same element in him that my
      task of keeping watch will never become a burden. In my day I have known
      many men with splendid qualities. Never have I known a man cleaner,
      brighter, and more simple than Oblomov. For many a man have I cherished an
      affection. Never for a man have I cherished an affection more ardent and
      lasting than that which I cherish for Oblomov. Once known, his personality
      is an entity for which one&rsquo;s love could never die.... Is that so? Have I
      divined aright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing: her eyes were fixed intently upon her work. Ar length
      she arose, ran to her husband, gazed into his eyes for a moment as she
      embraced him, and let her head sink forward upon his shoulder. During
      those few moments there had arisen to her memory Oblomov&rsquo;s kindly, pensive
      face, his tender, deprecating gaze, and the shy, wistful smile with which,
      at their last parting, he had met her reproaches. As she saw those things
      her heart ached with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never abandon him&mdash;you will never let him leave your
      sight?&rdquo; she asked with her arms around her husband&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never!&mdash;not though an abyss should open between us, and a
      dividing wall arise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor shall I ever forget the words which you have just spoken,&rdquo; she
      murmured.

      Quarter peace and quietness reigned supreme. They reigned in its unwashed
      streets, with their wooden sidewalks, and in its lean gardens amid the
      nettle-encumbered ditches, where a goat with a ragged cord around its neck
      was diligently engaged in cropping the herbage and snatching dull
      intervals of slumber. At midday, however, the high, smart boots of a clerk
      clattered along a sidewalk, the muslin curtain at a window was pulled
      aside to admit the features of a Civil Service official&rsquo;s lady, and for a
      brief moment there showed itself over a garden fence the fresh young face
      of a girl&mdash;then the face of a companion&mdash;then the face which had
      first appeared, as two maidens laughed and tittered during the process cf
      swinging each other on a garden swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also in the abode of Oblomov&rsquo;s landlady all was quiet. Had you entered the
      little courtyard, you would have happened upon an idyllic scene. The
      poultry would have started running hither and thither in fussy alarm, and
      the dogs given tongue in furious accents, while Akulina would have paused
      in her pursuit of milking the cow, and the <i>dvornik</i> in his task of
      chopping firewood, in order that they might gaze unhampered at the
      visitor. &ldquo;Whom do you wish to see?&rdquo; the <i>dvornik</i> would have
      inquired; and on your mentioning Oblomov&rsquo;s name, or that of the mistress
      of the house, he would have pointed to the steps of the front door, and
      then resumed his task of wood-chopping; whereupon the visitor would have
      followed the neat, sanded path to the steps (which he would have found
      covered with a plain, clean carpet of some sort), and, reaching for the
      brightly polished knob of the doorbell, would have had the door opened to
      him by Anisia, one of the children, the landlady herself, or Zakhar.
      Everything in Agafia Matvievna&rsquo;s establishment smacked of an opulence and
      a domestic sufficiency which had been lacking in the days when she had
      shared house with her brother, Tarantiev&rsquo;s bosom friend. The kitchen, the
      lumber-room, and the pantry were alike fitted with cupboards full of
      china, crockery, and household wares of every sort; while in cases were
      set out Oblomov&rsquo;s plate and articles of silver (long ago redeemed, and
      never since pledged). In short, the place abounded in such commodities as
      are to be found in the abode of every frugal housewife. Also, so carefully
      was everything packed in camphor and other preservatives that when Agafia
      Matvievna went to open the doors of the cupboards she could scarcely stand
      against the overwhelming perfume of mingled narcotics which came forth,
      and had to turn her head aside for a few moments. Hams hung from the
      ceiling of the storeroom (to avoid damage by mice), and, with them,
      cheeses, loaves-of&mdash;sugar, dried fish, and bags of nuts and preserved
      mushrooms. On a table stood tubs of butter, pots of sour cream, baskets of
      apples, and God knows what else besides, for it would require the pen of a
      scribe Homer to describe in full, and in detail, all that had become
      accumulated in the various corners and on the various floors of this
      little nest of domestic life. As for the kitchen, it was a veritable
      palladium of activity on the part of the mistress and her efficient
      assistant, Anisia. Everything was kept indoors and in its proper place;
      throughout there prevailed a system of orderliness and cleanliness; and
      only into one particular nook of the house did a ray of light, a breath of
      air, the good housewife&rsquo;s eye, and the nimble, all-furbishing hand of the
      domestic never penetrate. That nook was Zakhar&rsquo;s den. Lacking a window, it
      was so constantly plunged in darkness that its resemblance to a lair
      rather than to a human habitation was rendered the more complete. Whenever
      Zakhar surprised in his den the mistress of the house (come thither to
      plan a cleaning or various improvements) he explained to her, in forcible
      tenns, that it was not a woman&rsquo;s business to sweep out a place where
      faggots, blacking, and boots ought to lie, and that it mattered not a jot
      that clothes should be tossed in a heap on the floor, or that the bed in
      the stove corner had become overspread with dust, seeing that it was he,
      and not she, whose function it was to repose upon that bed. As for a
      besom, a few planks, a couple of bricks, the remains of a barrel, and two
      blocks of wood which he always kept in his room, he could not, he averred,
      get on in his domestic duties without them (though why that was so he left
      to the imagination). Finally, according to his own statement, neither the
      dust nor the cobwebs in the least inconvenienced him&mdash;to which he
      begged to add a reminder that, since he never obtruded his nose into the
      kitchen, he should be the more pleased if he could be left alone by those
      to whom the kitchen was at all times open. Once, when he surprised Anisia
      in his sanctum, he threatened her so furiously with uplifted fist that the
      case was referred to the court of superior instance&mdash;that is to say,
      to Oblomov himself, who walked supinely to the door of the den, inserted
      his head therein, scanned the apartment and its contents, sneezed, and
      returned mutely to his own quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you gained by it all?&rdquo; said Zakhar to the mistress and her
      myrmidon, who had accompanied Oblomov, in the hope that his participation
      in the affair would lead to a change of some sort. Then the old valet
      laughed to himself in a way which twisted his eyebrows and whiskers askew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other rooms of the house, however, everything looked bright and
      clean and fresh. The old stuff curtains had disappeared, and the doors and
      windows of the drawing-room and the study were hung with blue and green
      drapery and muslin curtains&mdash;the work of Agafia Matvievna&rsquo;s own
      hands. Indeed, for days at a time Oblomov, prone upon his sola, had
      watched her bare elbows flicker to and fro as she plied needle and thread;
      nor had he once gone to sleep to the sound of thread being alternately
      inserted and bitten off, as had been his custom in the old days at
      Oblomovka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of work,&rdquo; he had nevertheless said to her at intervals, &ldquo;Pray
      cease your labours for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she had always replied, &ldquo;God loves those who toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was his coffee prepared for him with less care, attention, and skill
      than had been the case before he had changed his old quarters for his
      present ones. Giblet soup, macaroni with Parmesan cheese, soup concocted
      of <i>kvass</i> and herbs, home-fed pullets&mdash;all these dishes
      succeeded one another in regular rotation, and by so doing helped to make
      agreeable breaks in the otherwise monotonous routine of the little
      establishment. Nor did the sun, whenever shining, fail to brighten his
      room from morning till night&mdash;thanks to the fact that the
      market-gardens on either side of the building prevented that luminary&rsquo;s
      rays from being shaded off by any obstacle. Outside, ducks quacked
      cheerfully, while, within, a geranium, added to a few hyacinths which the
      children had brought home, filled the little apartment with a perfume
      which mingled pleasantly with the smoke of Havana cigars and the scent of
      the cinnamon or the vanilla which the mistress of the house would be
      preparing with bare, energetic arms.

      Thus Oblomov lived in a sort of gilded cage&mdash;a cage within which, as
      in a diorama, the only changes included alternations of day and night and
      of the seasons. Of changes of the disturbing kind which stir up the
      sediment from the bottom of life&rsquo;s bowl&mdash;a sediment only too
      frequently both bitter and obnoxious&mdash;there were none. Ever since the
      day when Schtoltz had cleared him of debt, and Tarantiev and Tarantiev&rsquo;s
      friend had taken themselves off for good, every adverse element had
      disappeared from Oblomov&rsquo;s existence, and there surrounded him only good,
      kind, sensible folk who had agreed to underpin his existence with theirs,
      and to help him not to notice it, nor to feel it, as it pursued its even
      course. Everything was, as it were, at peace, and of that peace, that
      inertia, Oblomov represented the complete, the natural, embodiment and
      expression. After passing in review and considering his mode of life, he
      had sunk deeper and deeper therein, until finally he had come to the
      conclusion that he had no farther to go, and nothing farther to seek, and
      that the ideal of his life would best be preserved where he was&mdash;albeit
      without poetry, without those finer shades wherewith his imagination had
      once painted for him a spacious, careless course of manorial life on his
      own estate and among his own peasantry and servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his present mode of life he looked as a continuation of the
      Oblomovkan existence (only with a different colouring of locality, and, to
      a certain extent, of period). Here, as at Oblomovka, he had succeeded in
      escaping life, in driving a bargain with it, and ensuring to himself an
      inviolable seclusion. Inwardly he congratulated himself on having left
      behind him the irksome, irritating demands and menaces cf mundane
      existence&mdash;on having placed a great distance Between himself and the
      horizon where there may be seen flashing the lightning-bolts of keen
      pleasure, and whence come the thunderpeals of sudden affliction, and where
      flicker the false hopes and the splendid visions of average happiness, and
      where independence of thought gradually engulfs and devours a man, and
      where passion slays him outright, and where the intellect fails or
      triumphs, and where humanity engages in constant warfare, and leaves the
      field of battle in a state of exhaustion and of ever-unsatisfied,
      ever-insatiable desire. Never having experienced the consolations to be
      won in combat, he had none the less renounced them, and felt at ease only
      in a remote corner to which action and lighting and the actual living of
      life were alike strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet moments there were when his imagination stirred within him again, and
      when there recurred to his mind forgotten memories and unrealized dreams,
      and when he felt in his conscience whispered reproaches for having made of
      his life so little as he had done. And whenever that occurred he slept
      restlessly, awoke at intervals, leaped out of bed, and shed chill tears of
      hopelessness over the bright ideal that was now extinguished for ever. He
      shed them as folk shed them over a dead friend whom with bitter regret
      they recognize to have been neglected during his lifetime. Then he would
      glance at his surroundings, hug to himself his present blessings, and grow
      comforted on noting how quietly, how restfully, the sun was rising amid a
      blaze of glory. Thus he had come to a decision that not only was his life
      compounded in the best manner for expressing the possibilities to which
      the idealistic-peaceful side of human existence may attain, but also that
      it had been expressly created for and preordained to, that purpose. To
      others, he reflected, let it fall to express life&rsquo;s restless aspects; to
      others let it be given to exercise forces of construction and destruction;
      to each man be allotted his true <i>métier</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such the philosophy which our Plato of Oblomovka elaborated for the
      purpose of lulling himself to sleep amid the problems and the stern
      demands of duty and of destiny. He had been bred and nourished to play the
      part, not of a gladiator in the arena but of a peaceful onlooker at the
      struggle. Never could his diffident, lethargic spirit have faced either
      the raptures or the blows of life. Hence he expressed only one of its
      aspects, and had no mind either to succeed in it, or to change anything in
      it, or to repent of his decision. As the years flowed on both emotion and
      repining came to manifest themselves at rarer and rarer intervals, until,
      by quiet, imperceptible degrees, he became finally interned in the plain,
      otiose tomb of retirement which he had fashioned with his own hands, even
      as desert anchorites who have turned from the world dig for themselves a
      material sepulchre. Of reorganizing his estate, and removing thither with
      his household; he had given up all thought. The steward whom Schtoltz had
      placed in charge of Oblomovka regularly sent him the income therefrom, and
      the peasantry proffered him flour and poultry at Christmastide, and
      everything on the estate was prospering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he ate heartily and much, even as he had done at Oblomovka.
      Also, he walked and worked sluggishly and little&mdash;again, as he had
      done at Oblomovka. Lastly, in spite of his advancing years, he drank beer
      and <i>vodka à raisin</i> with complete <i>insouciance</i>, and took to
      sleeping ever more and more protractedly after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly a change occurred. One day, after his usual quota of slumber
      and day dreams, he tried to rise from the sofa, but failed, and his tongue
      refused to obey him. Terrified, he could compass only a gesture when he
      tried to call for help. Had he been living with Zakhar alone, he might
      have continued to signal for assistance until next morning, or have died,
      and not been found there till the following day; but, as it was, the eyes
      of his landlady had been watching over him like the eyes of Providence
      itself, and it cost her no skill of wit, but only an instinct of the
      heart, to divine that all was not well with Oblomov. No sooner had the
      instinct dawned upon her than Anisia was dispatched in a cab for a doctor,
      while Agafia Matvievna herself applied ice to the patient&rsquo;s head, and
      extracted from her medicine chest the whole armoury of smelling-bottles
      and fomentations which custom and report had designated for use at such a
      juncture. Even Zakhar managed to get one of his boots on, and, thus shod,
      to fuss around his master in company with the doctor, the mistress of the
      house, and Anisia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, blood having been let, Oblomov returned to consciousness, and
      was informed that he had just sustained an apoplectic stroke, and that he
      must adopt a different course of life. Henceforth, <i>vodka</i>, beer,
      wine, coffee, and rich food were, with certain exceptions, to be
      prohibited, while in their place there were prescribed for him daily
      exercise and a regular amount of sleep of an exclusively nocturnal nature.
      Even then these remedies would have come to nothing but for Agafia
      Matvievna&rsquo;s watchfulness; but she had the wit so to introduce the system
      that the entire household involuntarily assisted in its working. Thus,
      partly by, cunning and partly by kindness, she contrived to wean Oblomov
      from his attractive indulgences in wind, postprandial slumber, and fish
      pasties. For instance, as soon as ever he began to doze, either a chair
      would be unset in an adjoining room, or, of its own volition, some old and
      worthless crockery would begin flying into splinters, or the children
      would start making a noise, and be told, <i>fortissimo</i>, to be gone.
      Lastly, should even this not prove effective, her own kindly voice would
      be heard calling to him, in order to ask him some question or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the garden path was lengthened, and on it Oblomov accomplished,
      morning and evening, a constitutional of some two hours&rsquo; duration. With
      him there would walk the landlady&mdash;or, if she could not attend, one
      of the children, or his old friend, the irresponsible and to every man
      both humble and agreeable Alexiev. One morning Oblomov, leaning on the boy
      Vania&rsquo;s arm, slowly paced the path. By this time Vania had grown into
      almost a youth, and found it hard to restrict his brisk, rapid step to
      Oblomov&rsquo;s more tardy gait. As the elder man walked he made little use of
      one of his legs, which was a trace of the stroke which he had recently
      sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go indoors now, Vaniushka,&rdquo; he said; wherefore they directed their
      steps towards the door. But to meet them! there issued Agafia Matvievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you coming in so early?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early, indeed? Why, we have paced the path twenty times each way, and
      from here to the fence is a distance of fifty <i>sazhens</i>; wherefore we
      have covered two versts in all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how many times do <i>you</i> say you have paced it?&rdquo; she inquired of
      Vania.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not lie, but look me straight in the face,&rdquo; she continued, fixing him
      with her gaze. &ldquo;I have been watching you the whole time. Remember next
      Sunday. Possibly I might not let you go to the party that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; the boy said at length, &ldquo;we have paced the path only <i>twelve</i>
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you rogue!&rdquo; exclaimed Oblomov. &ldquo;You were nipping off acacia-leaves
      all the time, whereas <i>I</i> was keeping the most careful account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must go and do some more walking,&rdquo; decided the landlady.
      &ldquo;Besides, the fish soup is not yet ready.&rdquo; And she closed the door upon
      the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov, much against his will, completed another eight pacings of the
      path, and then entered the dining-room. On the large round table the fish
      soup was now steaming, and all hastened to take their usual seats&mdash;Oblomov
      in solitary state on the sofa, the landlady on his right, and the rest in
      due sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will help you to <i>this</i> herring, as it is the fattest,&rdquo; said
      Agafia Matvievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Only, I think that a pie would go well with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! I have forgotten the pies! I meant to make some last night, but
      my memory is all gone to pieces!&rdquo; The artful Agafia Matvievna! &ldquo;Besides, I
      am afraid that I have forgotten the cutlets and the cabbage. In fact, you
      must not expect very much of a dinner to-day.&rdquo; This was addressed
      ostensibly to Alexiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I can eat anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not cook him some pork and peas, or a beef-steak?&rdquo; asked Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> go to the butcher&rsquo;s for a beefsteak, but there was not a
      single morsel of good beef left. However, I have made Monsieur Alexiev a
      cherry <i>compote</i> instead. I know he likes that.&rdquo; The truth was that
      cherry <i>compote was not</i> bad for Oblomov; wherefore the complacent
      Alexiev had no choice but both to eat it and to like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner no power on earth could prevent Oblomov from assuming a
      recumbent position; so, to obviate his going to sleep, the landlady was
      accustomed to place beside him his coffee, and then to inspire, her
      children to play games on the floor, so that, willy-nilly, Oblomov should
      be forced to join in their sport. Presently she withdrew to the kitchen to
      see if the coffee was yet ready, and, meanwhile, the children&rsquo;s clatter
      died away. Almost at once a gentle snore arose in the room&mdash;then a
      louder one&mdash;then one louder still; and when Agafia Matvievna returned
      with the steaming coffee-pot she encountered such a volume of snoring as
      would have done credit to a post-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angrily she shook her head at Alexiev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my fault,&rdquo; he said deprecatingly. &ldquo;I tried to stir up the
      children, but they would not listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly depositing the coffee-pot upon the table, she caught up little
      Andriusha from the floor, and gently seated him upon the sofa by Oblomov&rsquo;s
      side; whereupon the child wriggled towards him, climbed his form until he
      had reached his face, and grasped him firmly by the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! Hullo I Who is that?&rdquo; cried Oblomov uneasily as he opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had gone to sleep, so Andriusha climbed on to the sofa and awoke
      you,&rdquo; replied the landlady kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had gone to sleep, indeed?&rdquo; retorted Oblomov, laying his arm around the
      little one. &ldquo;Do you think I did not hear him creeping along on all fours?
      Why, I hear <i>everything</i>. To think of the little rascal catching me
      by the nose! I&rsquo;ll give it him! But there, there.&rdquo; Tenderly embracing the
      child, he deposited him on the floor again, and heaved a profound sigh.
      &ldquo;Tell us the news, Ivan Alexiev,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard it all. I have nothing more to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? You go into society, and I do not. Is there nothing new in the
      political world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is being said that the earth is growing colder every day, and that one
      day it will become frozen altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away with you! Is <i>that</i> politics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence ensued. Oblomov quietly relapsed into a state of coma that was
      neither sleeping nor waking. He merely let his thoughts wander at will,
      without concentrating them upon anything in particular as calmly he
      listened to the beating of his heart and occasionally blinked his eyes.
      Thus he sank into a vague, enigmatical condition which partook largely of
      the nature of hallucination. In rare instances there come to a man
      fleeting moments of abstraction when he seems to be reliving past stages
      of his life. Whether he has previously beheld in sleep the phenomena which
      are passing before his vision, or whether he has gone through a previous
      existence and has since forgotten it, we cannot say; but at all events he
      can see the same persons around him as were present in the first instance,
      and hear the same words as were uttered then.
    </p>
    <p>
      So was it with Oblomov now. Gradually there spread itself about him the
      hush which he had known long ago. He could hear the beating of the
      well-known pendulum, the snapping of the thread as it was bitten off, and
      the repetition of familiar whispered sentences like &ldquo;I cannot make the
      thread go through the eye of the needle. Pray do it for me, Masha&mdash;your
      eyesight is keener than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lazily, mechanically he looked into his landlady&rsquo;s face; and straightway
      from the recesses of his memory there arose a picture which, somewhere,
      had been well known to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his vision there dawned the great, dark drawing-room in the house of
      his youth, lit by a single candle. At the table his mother and her guests
      were sitting over their needlework, while his father was silently pacing
      up and down. Somehow the present and the past had become fused and
      interchanged, so that, as the little Oblomov, he was dreaming that at
      length he had reached the enchanted country where the rivers run milk and
      honey, and bread can be obtained without toil, and every one walks clad in
      gold and silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again he could hear the old legends and the old folk-tales, mingled
      with the clatter of knives and crockery in the kitchen. Once again he was
      pressing close to his nurse to listen to her tremulous, old woman&rsquo;s voice.
      &ldquo;That is Militrissa Kirbitievna,&rdquo; she was saying as she pointed to the
      figure of his landlady. Also, the same clouds seemed to be floating in the
      blue zenith that used to float there of yore, and the same wind to be
      blowing in at the window, and ruffling his hair, and the same cock of the
      Oblomovkan poultry-yard to be strutting and crowing below. Suddenly a dog
      barked. Some other guest must be arriving! Would it be old Schtoltz and
      his little boy from Verklevo? Yes, probably, for to-day is a holiday. And
      in very truth it <i>is</i> they&mdash;he can hear their footsteps
      approaching nearer and nearer! The door opens, and &ldquo;Andrei!&rdquo; he exclaims
      excitedly, for there, sure enough, stands his friend&mdash;but now grown
      to manhood, and no longer a little boy!...

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>blomov recovered
      consciousness. Before him Schtoltz <i>was</i> standing&mdash;but the
      Schtoltz of the present, not the Schtoltz of a daydream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly the landlady caught up the baby Andriusha, swept the table clear
      of her work, and carried off the children. Alexiev also disappeared, and
      Schtoltz and Oblomov found themselves alone. For a moment or two they
      gazed at one another amid a tense silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that really you. Schtoltz?&rdquo; asked Oblomov in tones scarcely audible
      for emotion&mdash;such tones as a man employs only towards his dearest
      friend and after a long separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is I,&rdquo; replied Schtoltz quietly. &ldquo;And you&mdash;are you quite
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov embraced him heartily. In that embrace were expressed all the
      long-concealed grief and joy which, fermenting ever in his soul, had
      never, since Schtoltz&rsquo;s last departure, been expressed to any human being.
      Then they seated themselves, and once more gazed at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you <i>really</i> well?&rdquo; Schtoltz asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank God!&rdquo; replied Oblomov. &ldquo;But you have been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I was seized with a stroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Evidently you have let yourself go again. What have you
      been doing? Actually, it is five years since last we saw one another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov sighed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you not come to Oblomovka?&rdquo; pursued Schtoltz. &ldquo;And why have
      you never written to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was there to say?&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s sad reply. &ldquo;You know me.
      Consequently you need ask no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are still living in these rooms?&rdquo; And Schtoltz surveyed the room
      as he spoke. &ldquo;Why have you not moved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am still here. I do not think the move will ever take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I <i>am</i> sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Schtoitz eyed him closely, then became thoughtful, and started to
      pace the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of Olga Sergievna?&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s next question. &ldquo;Where is she
      now, and does she still remember me?&rdquo; At this point he broke off abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is well, and has of you a remembrance as clear as though she had
      parted from you yesterday. Presently I will tell you where she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children too are well. But are you jesting when you say that you are
      going to remain where you are? My express purpose in coming here is to
      carry you off to our place in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Oblomov, though lowering his voice as he glanced at the
      door. Evidently the proposal had disturbed him greatly. &ldquo;Do not say a word
      about it,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Do not begin your arguments again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why will you not come? What is the matter with you? You know me well,
      and know that long ago I undertook this task, and shall never relinquish
      it. Hitherto business affairs have occupied my time, but now I am free
      once more. Come and live with us, or, at all events, near us. Olga and I
      have decided that you <i>must</i> do so. Thank God that I have found you
      the same as before, and not worse! My hopes of doing that had been small.
      Let us be off at once. I am prepared even to abduct you by force. You <i>must</i>
      change your mode of life, as you well know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this speech Oblomov listened with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak so loudly,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;In there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the landlady, and, should she hear us, she will think that I am going
      to leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should you not leave her? Let her think what she likes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Andrei.&rdquo; Oblomov&rsquo;s tone was one of unwonted firmness. &ldquo;Do not
      continue your useless attempts to persuade me. Come what may, I must
      remain where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schtoltz gazed at his friend in astonishment, but Oblomov returned the
      gaze with quiet resolution on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain here, and you are lost,&rdquo; said Schtoltz. &ldquo;This house, that woman,
      this way of living?&mdash;I tell you the thing cannot be Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught Oblomov by the sleeve, and started to drag him towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to take me away?&rdquo; asked Oblomov, hanging back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want you to leave this den, this swamp, for the world of light
      and air and health and normal existence.&rdquo; Schtoltz was speaking sternly,
      and almost in a tone of command. &ldquo;To what point have you sunk?&rdquo; he went
      on. &ldquo;What is going to become of you? Think for a moment. Are you so
      attached to this mode of life that you wish to go to sleep like a mole in
      its burrow? Remember that&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to remember nothing. Do not disturb the past. It can never be
      brought back again.&rdquo; Into Oblomov&rsquo;s face there had come a full
      consciousness of his power to think, to reason, and to will. &ldquo;What is it
      you wish me to do? From the world to which you would abduct me I have
      parted for ever; and to solder together two pieces which have started
      asunder is impossible. I have grown to look upon this nook as my world.
      Should you uproot me from it, I shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at the place, at the people with whom you are living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean&mdash;I am perfectly conscious of the facts. Ah,
      Andrei, believe me when I say that so well do I feel and understand things
      that for many a day past I have been ashamed to show myself abroad. Yet I
      cannot accompany you on your road. Even did I wish it, such a course is
      out of my power. Possibly, when you were last here, I <i>might</i> have
      made the attempt; but now&rdquo;&mdash;here he dropped his eyes for a moment and
      paused&mdash;&ldquo;now it is too late. Go, and waste no further time upon me.
      Your friendship, as God in heaven knows, I value; but your disturbance of
      my peace I do <i>not</i> value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that you can say will turn me from my purpose. I intend to carry
      you off, ard the more so because I suspect certain things. Look here. Put
      on a garment of some sort, and come and spend the evening at my rooms. I
      have much to tell you, for I suppose you know what is afoot at our place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I had forgotten,&rdquo; Schtoltz went on. &ldquo;You no longer go into society.
      Well, come with me, and I will tell you the whole story. Also, do you know
      who is waiting for me in a carriage at the gates? I will go and call her
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Olga?&rdquo; As the words burst tremulously from Oblomov&rsquo;s lips his face
      underwent a sudden change. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake do not bring her here! Go, go
      for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the elder man refused to move, although his friend half started to
      push him towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot return to her without you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have pledged my word on
      that. If you will not come with me to-day, then you must come to-morrow.
      You are merely putting me off for a time: you will never put me off for
      ever. Even should it be the day after to-morrow, we still shall meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oblomov said nothing, but hung his head as though afraid to meet
      Schtoltz&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you coming, therefore?&rdquo; went on Schtoltz. &ldquo;Olga will be sure to
      ask me when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Andrei,&rdquo; cried the other in a tone of affectionate appeal as he
      embraced his friend and laid his head upon his shoulder, &ldquo;Pray leave me
      and&mdash;<i>forget</i> me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? For ever?&rdquo; cried Schtoltz in astonishment as he withdrew a little
      from Oblomov&rsquo;s embrace in order the better to look him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered Oblomov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schtoltz stepped, back a pace or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this really be you, Ilya?&rdquo; he exclaimed reproachfully. &ldquo;Do you really
      reject me in favour of that woman, of that landlady of yours?&rdquo; He started
      with a sudden pang. &ldquo;So that child which I saw just new is <i>your</i>
      child? Ah, Ilya, Ilya! Come hence at once. How you have fallen! What is
      that woman to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is my wife,&rdquo; said Oblomov simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schtoltz stood petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the child is my son,&rdquo; Oblomov continued. &ldquo;He has been called
      Andrei after yourself.&rdquo; Somehow he seemed to breathe more freely now that
      he had got rid of the burden of these disclosures. As for Schtoltz, his
      face fell, and he gazed around the room with vacant eyes. A gulf had
      opened before him, a high wall had suddenly shot up, and Oblomov seemed to
      have ceased to exist&mdash;he seemed to have vanished from his friend&rsquo;s
      sight, and to have fallen headlong. The only feeling in Schtoltz&rsquo;s mind
      was an aching sorrow of the kind which a man experiences when, hastening
      to visit a friend after a long parting, he finds that for many a day past
      that friend has been dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lost!&rdquo; he kept whispering mechanically. &ldquo;What am I to say to
      Olga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length Oblomov caught the last words, and tried to say something, but
      failed. All he could do was to extend his hands in Schtoltz&rsquo;s direction.
      Silently, convulsively the pair embraced, even as before death or a
      battle. In that embrace was left no room for words or tears or expressions
      of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never forget my little Andrei,&rdquo; was Oblomov&rsquo;s last choking utterance.
      Slowly and silently Schtoltz left the house. Slowly and silently he
      crossed the courtyard and entered the carriage. When he had gone Oblomov
      reseated himself upon the sofa in his room, rested his elbows upon the
      table, and buried his face in his hands....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never will I forget your little Andrei,&rdquo; thought Schtoltz sadly as he
      drove homewards. &ldquo;Ah, Ilya, you are lost beyond recall! It would be
      useless now to tell you that your Oblomovka is no longer in ruins, that
      its turn is come again, and that it is basking in the rays of the sun. It
      would be useless now to tell you that, some four years hence, it will have
      a railway-station, and that your peasantry are clearing away the rubbish
      there, and that before long an iron road will be carrying your grain to
      the wharves, and that already local schools have been built. Such a dawn
      of good fortune would merely affright you; it would merely cause you:
      unaccustomed eyes to smart. Yet along the road which you could not tread I
      will lead your little Andrei; and with him I will put into practice those
      theories whereof you and I used to dream in the days of our youth.
      Farewell, Oblomovka of the past! You have outlived your day!&rdquo; For the last
      time Schtoltz looked back at Oblomov&rsquo;s diminutive establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; asked Olga with a beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Schtollz answered dryly and abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he alive and well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the reluctant reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you returned so soon? Why did you not call me to the house,
      or else bring him out to see me? Let me go back, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? What has happened there? Will you not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schtoltz continued to say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I ask you: what is the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disease of Oblomovka,&rdquo; was the grim response. And throughout the rest
      of the journey homeward Schtoltz refused to answer a single one of Olga&rsquo;s
      questions.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ive years have
      passed, and more than one change has taken place in the Veaborg Quarter.
      The street which used to lead, unenclosed, to Oblomov&rsquo;s humble abode is
      now lined with villas. In the midst of them a tall stone Government office
      rears its head between the sunlight and the windows of that quiet,
      peaceful little house which the sun&rsquo;s rays once warmed so cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house itself has grown old and crazy: it wears a dull, neglected look
      like that of a man who is unshaven and unwashed. In places the paint has
      peeled away, and in others the gutters are broken. To the latter is due
      the fact that pools of dirty water stand in the courtyard, and that thrown
      across them is a piece of old planking. Should a visitor approach the
      wicket, the old watchdog no longer leaps nimbly to the extent of his
      chain, but gives tongue hoarsely and lazily from the interior of his
      kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, within the house, what changes have taken place! Over it there reigns
      a different housewife to the former one, and different children sport in
      play. Again is seen about the premises the lean countenance of Tarantiev,
      rather than the kindly, careless features of Alexiev; while of Zakhar and
      Anisia also there is not a sign discernible. A new cook performs, rudely
      and unwillingly, the quiet behests of Agafia Matvievna, and our old friend
      Akulina&mdash;her apron girded around her middle&mdash;washes up, as
      formerly, the domestic crockery and the pots and pans. Lastly, the same
      old sleepy <i>dvornik</i> whiles away the same old idle life in the same
      old den by the gates, and at a given hour each morning, as well as always
      at the hour of the evening meal, there flashes past the railings of the
      fence the figure of Agafia&rsquo;s brother, clad, summer and winter alike, in
      galoshes, and always carrying under his arm a large bundle of documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of Oblomov? Where is he&mdash;where? Under a modest urn in the
      adjoining cemetery his body rests among the shrubs. All is quiet where he
      is lying; only a lilac-tree, planted there by a loving hand, waves its
      boughs to and fro over the grave as it mingles its scent with the sweet,
      calm odour of wormwood. One would think that the <i>Angel of Peace</i>
      himself were watching over the dead man&rsquo;s slumbers....
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his wife&rsquo;s ceaseless and devoted care for every moment of his
      existence, the prolonged inertia, the unbroken stillness, the sluggish
      gliding from day to day had ended by quietly arresting the machine of
      life. Thus Oblomov met his end, to all appearances without pain, without
      distress, even as stops a watch which its owner has&mdash;forgotten to
      wind up. No one witnessed his last moments or heard his expiring gasp. A
      second stroke of apoplexy occurred within a year of the first, and, like
      its precursor, passed away favourably. Later, however, Oblomov became pale
      and weak, took to eating little and seldom walking in the garden, and
      increased in moodiness and taciturnity as the days went on. At times he
      would even burst into tears, for he felt death drawing nearer, and was
      afraid of it. One or two relapses occurred, from which he rallied, and
      then Agafia Matvievna entered his room, one morning, to find him resting
      on his deathbed as quietly as he had done in sleep&mdash;the only
      difference being that his head had slipped a little from the pillow, and
      that one of his hands was convulsively clutching the region of the heart
      in a manner which suggested that the pain had there centred itself until
      the circulation of the blood had stopped for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his death Agafia Matvievna&rsquo;s sister-in-law, Irina Paptelievna,
      assumed control of the establishment. That is to say, she arrogated to
      herself the right to rise late in the morning, to drink three cups of
      coffee for breakfast, to change her dress three times a day, and to
      confine her housewifely energies to seeing that her gowns were starched to
      the utmost degree of stiffness. More she would not trouble to undertake,
      and, as before, Agafia Matvievna remained the active pendulum of the
      domestic clock. Not only did she superintend the kitchen and the
      dining-room, and prepare tea and coffee for the entire household, but also
      she did the general mending and supervised the linen, the children,
      Akulina, and the <i>dvornik</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was this? Was she not Madame Oblomov and the proprietress of a landed
      estate? Might she not have maintained a separate, an independent
      establishment, and have wanted for nothing, and have been at no one&rsquo;s beck
      and call? What had led her to take upon her shoulders the burden of
      another&rsquo;s housekeeping, the care of another&rsquo;s children, and all those
      petty details which women usually assume only at the call of love, or in
      obedience to sacred family ties, or for the purpose of earning a morsel of
      daily bread? Where, too, were Zakhar and Anisia&mdash;now become, by every
      right of law, her servants? Where, too, was the little treasure, Andrei,
      which Oblomov had bequeathed her? Where, finally, were her children by her
      first husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those children were now all provided for. That is to say, Vania had
      finished his schooling and entered Government service, his sister had
      married the manager of a Government office, and little Andrei had been
      committed to the care of Schtoltz and his wife, who looked upon him as a
      member of their own family. Never for a moment did Agafia Matvievna
      mentally compare his lot, or place it on a level with, that of her first
      children&mdash;although, unconsciously it may be, she allotted them all an
      equal place in her heart. In her opinion the little Andrei&rsquo;s upbringing,
      mode of life, and future career stood divided by an immeasurable gulf from
      the fortunes of Vania and his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are <i>they?</i>&rdquo; she would say to herself when she called to see
      Andrei. &ldquo;They are children born of the people, whereas this one was born a
      young <i>barin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she would caress the boy, if not with actual timidity, at all events
      with a certain touch of caution, and add to herself with something like
      respect: &ldquo;What a white skin he has! &rsquo;Tis almost transparent. And
      what tiny hands and feet, too, and what silky hair! He is just like his
      dead father.&rdquo; Consequently she was the more ready to accede to Schtoltz&rsquo;s
      request when he asked her that he (Schtoltz) should educate the youngster;
      since she felt sure that Schtoltz&rsquo;s household was far more the lad&rsquo;s
      proper place than was her own establishment, where he would have been
      thrown among her grimy young nephews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clad in black, she would glide like a shadow from room to room of the
      house&mdash;opening and shutting cupboards, sewing, making lace, but doing
      everything quietly, and without the least sign of energy. When spoken to,
      she would reply as though to do so were an effort. Moreover, her eyes no
      longer glanced swiftly from object to object, as they had done in the old
      days: rather, they remained fixed in a sort of ever concentrated gaze.
      Probably they had assumed that gaze during the hour when she had stood
      looking at her dead husband&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the light of her life was fast flickering before going out, that God
      had breathed His breath into her existence and taken it away again, and
      that her sun had shone brilliantly and was setting for ever, she clearly
      understood. Yes, that sun was setting for ever, but not before she had
      learnt the reason why she had been given life, and the fact that she had
      not lived in vain. Greatly she had loved, and to the full: she had loved
      <i>Oblomov</i> as a lover, as a husband, and as a <i>barin</i>. But around
      her there was no one to comprehend this; wherefore she kept her grief the
      more closely locked, in her own bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, next winter, when Schtoltz came to town, she ran to see him, and to
      gaze hungrily at little Andrei, whom she covered with caresses. Presently
      she tried to say something&mdash;to thank Schtoltz, and to pour out before
      him all that had been accumulating in her heart in the absence of an
      outlet. Such words he would have understood perfectly, had they been
      uttered. But the task was beyond her&mdash;she could only throw herself
      upon Olga, glue her lips to her hand, and burst into such a torrent of
      scalding tears that perforce Olga wept with her, and Schtoltz, greatly
      moved, hastened from the room. All three had now a common bond of sympathy&mdash;that
      bond being the memory of Oblomov&rsquo;s unsullied soul. More than once Schtoltz
      and Olga besought the widow to come and live with them in the country, but
      always she replied: &ldquo;Where I was born and have lived my live, there must I
      also die.&rdquo; Likewise, when Schtoltz proposed to render her an account of
      his management of the Oblomovkan property, she returned him the income
      therefrom, with a request that he should lay it by for the benefit of
      little Andrei.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis his, not mine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>He</i> is the <i>barin</i>, and
      I will continue to live as I have always done.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne day, about
      noon, two gentlemen were walking along a pavement in the Veaborg Quarter,
      while behind them a carriage quietly paced. One of the gentlemen was
      Schtoltz, the other a literary friend of his&mdash;a stout individual with
      an apathetic face and sleepy, meditative eyes. As they drew level with a
      church, Mass had just ended, and the congregation was pouring into the
      street. In front of them a knot of beggars was collecting a rich and
      varied harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where these mendicants come from,&rdquo; said the literary gentleman,
      glancing at the reapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of sundry nooks and corners, I suppose,&rdquo; replied the other
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not what I meant. What I meant is, how have they descended to
      their present position of beggars? Have they come to it suddenly or
      gradually, for a good reason or for a bad one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so anxious to know? Are you contemplating writing a
      &lsquo;Mysteries of Petrograd&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; the literary gentleman explained with an indolent yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here is a chance for you. Ask any one of them, and, for the sum of a
      rouble, he will sell you his story, which, jotted down, you could resell
      to the nobility. For instance, take this old man here. He looks a good
      example of the normal type. Hi, old man! We want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned his head at the summons, doffed his cap, and approached
      the two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sirs,&rdquo; he whined, &ldquo;pray help a poor man who has been wounded in
      thirty battles and grown old in war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Zakhar!&rdquo; exclaimed Schtoltz in astonishment. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> you,
      Zakhar, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Zakhar said nothing. Then suddenly, he shaded his eyes from the sun,
      and, staring intently at Schtoltz, muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, your Honour&mdash;I do not recognize you. I am nearly blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You have forgotten your old friend, the <i>bavin</i> Schtoltz?&rdquo; the
      other asked reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear! Is it <i>really</i> your Honour? My bad sight has got the
      better of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catching Schtoltz impetuously by the hand, the old man imprinted kiss
      after kiss upon the skirt of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord Himself has permitted a poor lost wretch to see a joyful day!&rdquo;
       he said, half-laughing, half-crying. Over his face, and particularly over
      his rose, there had spread a purplish tinge, while his head was almost
      completely bald, and his whiskers, though still long, looked so matted and
      entangled as to resemble pieces of felt wherein snowballs have been
      wrapped. As for his clothing, it consisted of an old, faded cloak, with
      one of the lapels missing, and a pair of down-at-heel goloshes. In his
      hands was a cap from which the fur had become worn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good sir!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Heaven has indeed granted me joy for
      to-day&rsquo;s festival!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you in this state?&rdquo; Schtoltz inquired. &ldquo;Are you not ashamed
      of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Honour; but what else could I do?&rdquo; And Zakhar heaved a profound
      sigh. &ldquo;How else was I to live? So long as Anisia was alive I had <i>not</i>
      to go wandering about like this, for I was given bite and sup whenever I
      wanted it; but she died of cholera (Heaven rest her soul!), and her
      brother straightway refused to support me, saying that I was nothing but
      an old hanger-on. From Michei Andreitch Tarantiev too I received shameful
      abuse, and neither of them&mdash;would you believe it, your Honour?&mdash;ever
      gave me a morsel of bread! Indeed, had it not been for the <i>barinia</i>,
      God bless her&rdquo;&mdash;and Zakhar crossed himself&mdash;&ldquo;I should long ago
      have perished of the cold; but for a while she gave me a bit of clothing,
      and as much bread as I could eat, and a place by the stove of a night.
      Then they took to rating her on my account; so at last I left the house to
      wander whither my eyes might lead me. This is the second year that I have
      been dragging out this miserable existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you not go and seek a situation?&rdquo; Schtoltz inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was I to get one at this time of day, your Honour? True, I tried
      for two, but was unsuccessful. Things are not what they used to be:
      everything has changed for the worse. Nowadays masters require their
      lacqueys to look respectable, and the gentry no longer keep their halls
      chock-full of footmen. Indeed, &rsquo;tis seldom that you will find so
      many as <i>two</i> footmen in a house. Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the gentry
      actually take off their<i> own boots! They have even gone so </i>far as to
      invent a machine to do it with!&rdquo; Evidently the idea cut Zakhar to the
      heart. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;our gentry are a shame and a disgrace to the
      country. They are fast coming to rack and ruin.&rdquo; A sigh of profound regret
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one place,&rdquo; presently he resumed, &ldquo;I did obtain a situation. &rsquo;Twas
      with a German merchant, who engaged me to be his hall lacquey. After a
      while, however, he sent me to serve in the pantry. Now, was <i>that</i> my
      proper business? One day I was carrying some crockery across the room on a
      tray, and the floor happened to be smooth and slippery, and down I fell,
      and the tray and the crockery with me. So I was turned out of doors. Next,
      an old countess took a fancy to my looks. &lsquo;He is of respectable
      appearance,&rsquo; she said to herself, and added me to her staff of Swiss
      lacqueys. The post was a light one, and bid fair to be permanent, too. All
      that I had to do was to sit as solemnly as possible on a chair, to cross
      one leg over the other, and, when any rascal called, not to answer him,
      but just to grunt and send the fellow away&mdash;or else give him a box on
      the ear. Of course, to the gentry one had to behave differently&mdash;just
      to wave one&rsquo;s staff like this.&rdquo; Zakhar gave an illustration of what he
      meant. &ldquo;As I say, &rsquo;twas an easy job, and the lady, God bless her!
      was not overdifficult to please. But one day she happened to peep into my
      room and to see there a bug. With that she bristled up and shrieked as
      though it had been <i>I</i> who had invented bugs! When was a household <i>ever</i>
      without a bug? So the next time she passed me she pretended that I smelt
      of liquor, and dismissed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you smell of it now&mdash;and very strongly,&rdquo; remarked Schtoltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my sorrow, I suppose so,&rdquo; whined Zakhar, wrinkling his brow bitterly.
      &ldquo;Well, then I tried to get a coachman&rsquo;s job, and took service with a
      gentleman; but one day I had my feet frost-bitten (for I was overold and
      weak for the job), and another day the brute of a horse fell down and
      nearly broke my ribs, and another day I ran over an old woman and got
      taken to the police-station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! Instead of drinking and getting yourself into trouble, come
      to my house, and I will give you a corner there until it is time for us to
      return to the country. Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Honour&mdash;yes; but, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zakhar sighed again. &ldquo;I would rather not leave these parts. You see, the
      grave is here&mdash;the grave where my old patron is lying.&rdquo; Zakhar
      sobbed. &ldquo;Only to-day I have been there to commend his soul to God. What a
      <i>barin</i> the Lord God has taken from us! &rsquo;Twould have been good
      for us if he could have lived another hundred years. Yes, only to-day I
      have been visiting his grave. Whenever I am near the spot I go and sit
      beside it, and shed tears&mdash;ah, such tears! And sometimes, too, when
      all is quiet there, I seem to hear him calling to me once more, &lsquo;Zakhar!
      Zakhar!&rsquo;&mdash;and shivers go running down my back. Never lived there such
      a <i>barin</i> as he! And how fond of yourself he was, your Honour! May
      the Lord remember him when the heavenly kingdom shall come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to see our little Andrei,&rdquo; said Schtoltz. &ldquo;If you like, you can
      have charge of him.&rdquo; And he handed the old man some money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>will</i> come! How could I not come when it is to see little
      Andrei Ilyitch? By this time he must be grown into a tall young gentleman.
      What joy the Lord has reserved for me this day! Yes, I <i>will</i> come,
      your Honour, and may God send you good health and many a long year of
      life!&rdquo; But it was after a departing carriage that Zakhar was dispatching
      his benedictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear the old beggar&rsquo;s story?&rdquo; Schtoltz asked of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Who was the Oblomov whom he mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was&mdash;Oblomov. More than once I have spoken to you of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I think I remember the name. Yes, he was a friend and comrade of
      yours, was he not? What became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to rack and ruin&mdash;though for no apparent reason.&rdquo; As he
      spoke Schtoltz sighed heavily. Then he added: &ldquo;His intellect was equal to
      that of his fellow&rsquo;s, his soul was as clear and as bright as glass, his
      disposition was kindly, and he was a gentleman to the core. Yet he&mdash;he
      fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore? What was the cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cause?&rdquo; re-echoed Schtoltz. &ldquo;The cause was&mdash;the disease of
      Oblomovka.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disease of Oblomovka?&rdquo; queried the literary gentleman in some
      perplexity. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I will tell you. For the moment leave me to my thoughts and
      memories. Hereafter you shall write them down, for they might prove of
      value to some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In time Schtoltz related to his friend what herein is to be found
      recorded.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
